Did you know? Over [800 contributors](https://github.com/processing/p5.js?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors) have shaped p5.js over the years! We believe the most meaningful innovations are those built **by and with our community**.

p5.js is not just a software but a community. Contributors across continents work around the clock to make p5.js more accessible, playful, and enjoyable for learners, because we believe that innovations are extra meaningful when they’re built by our community.

Our software gets to stay **free and open-source** thanks to generous donors like you. If p5.js has brightened your day in any way, **will you consider making a monthly donation**?

Thanks to our supporters who donated to the 2024 fundraiser, we were able to compensate p5.js contributors like [Vivek Bopaliya](https://medium.com/@ProcessingOrg/building-the-private-sketch-feature-what-made-this-journey-so-special-7c4a6b0de8f9) to build the private sketch feature for the p5.js Editor.
