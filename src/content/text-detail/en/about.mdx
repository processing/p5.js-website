## What is p5.js

p5.js is a friendly tool for learning to code and make art. It is a free and open-source JavaScript library built by an inclusive, nurturing community. p5.js welcomes artists, designers, beginners, educators, and anyone else!

p5.js prioritizes accessibility, inclusivity, community, and joy. It makes sketching with code as intuitive as sketching in a notebook. p5.js supports audio-visual, interactive, and experimental works for the web. It is accessible in many languages and has expansive documentation with visual examples. You can start coding right now in the web editor, and there are lots of tutorials to help. You can also expand p5.js with many community-created libraries. p5.js is always looking for contributors and appreciates involvement in all forms.

p5.js encourages iterative coding for creative expression. We value open source and access for all. Our community provides inspiration and support to learn, create, imagine, design, share, and code freely.

## Community Statement

The p5.js community shares an interest in exploring the creation of art and design with technology. We are a community of, and in solidarity with, people from every gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, disability, class, caste, religion, culture, subculture, immigration status, age, skill level, occupation, and background. We stand in solidarity with justice and liberation movements. We work to acknowledge, dismantle, and prevent barriers to access p5.js code and the p5.js community. 

Community values:
- We prioritize access as a foundational practice of community care. 
- We are all learners. We share and value many kinds of knowledge. We do not assume knowledge or imply that somebody should already know. We maintain a beginner’s mind, and believe that newcomers are just as valuable as experts. 
- We always try to offer help or guidance when we can, and we engage actively with feedback. 
- We acknowledge that not everyone has the time, financial means, or capacity to participate actively, but we recognize and encourage contributions of all kinds. 
- We approach conflict as a natural part of community and an invitation to re-align with our values. We collectively uphold and follow our Code of Conduct to ensure accountability in our community.
