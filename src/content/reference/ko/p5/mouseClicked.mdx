description: >
  <p>A function that's called once after a mouse button is pressed and
  released.</p>

  <p>Declaring the function <code>mouseClicked()</code> sets a code block to run

  automatically when the user releases a mouse button after having pressed

  it:</p>

  <code>

  function mouseClicked() {
    // Code to run.
  }

  </code>


  <p>The mouse system variables, such as <a
  href="/reference/p5/mouseX">mouseX</a> and

  <a href="/reference/p5/mouseY">mouseY</a>, will be updated with their most
  recent

  value when <code>mouseClicked()</code> is called by p5.js:</p>

  <code>

  function mouseClicked() {
    if (mouseX < 50) {
      // Code to run if the mouse is on the left.
    }

  <p>  if (mouseY > 50) {
      // Code to run if the mouse is near the bottom.
    }
  }

  </p></code>

  <p>The parameter, <code>event</code>, is optional. <code>mouseClicked()</code>
  is always passed a

  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent"
  target="_blank">MouseEvent</a>

  object with properties that describe the mouse click event:</p>

  <code>

  function mouseClicked(event) {
    // Code to run that uses the event.
    console.log(event);
  }

  </code>


  <p>On touchscreen devices, <code>mouseClicked()</code> will run when a user’s
  touch

  ends if <a href="/reference/p5/touchEnded">touchEnded()</a> isn’t declared. If

  <a href="/reference/p5/touchEnded">touchEnded()</a> is declared, then

  <a href="/reference/p5/touchEnded">touchEnded()</a> will run when a user’s
  touch

  ends and <code>mouseClicked()</code> won’t.</p>

  <p>Browsers may have default behaviors attached to various mouse events. For

  example, some browsers highlight text when the user moves the mouse while

  pressing a mouse button. To prevent any default behavior for this event,

  add <code>return false;</code> to the end of the function.</p>

  <p>Note: <a href="/reference/p5/mousePressed">mousePressed()</a>,

  <a href="/reference/p5/mouseReleased">mouseReleased()</a>,

  and <code>mouseClicked()</code> are all related.

  <a href="/reference/p5/mousePressed">mousePressed()</a> runs as soon as the
  user

  clicks the mouse. <a href="/reference/p5/mouseReleased">mouseReleased()</a>
  runs as

  soon as the user releases the mouse click. <code>mouseClicked()</code> runs

  immediately after <a
  href="/reference/p5/mouseReleased">mouseReleased()</a>.</p>
