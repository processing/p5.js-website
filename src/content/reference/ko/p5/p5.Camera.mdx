description: >
  <p>A class to describe a camera for viewing a 3D sketch.</p>

  <p>Each <code>p5.Camera</code> object represents a camera that views a section
  of 3D

  space. It stores information about the camera’s position, orientation, and

  projection.</p>

  <p>In WebGL mode, the default camera is a <code>p5.Camera</code> object that
  can be

  controlled with the <a href="/reference/p5/camera">camera()</a>,

  <a href="/reference/p5/perspective">perspective()</a>,

  <a href="/reference/p5/ortho">ortho()</a>, and

  <a href="/reference/p5/frustum">frustum()</a> functions. Additional cameras
  can be

  created with <a href="/reference/p5/createCamera">createCamera()</a> and
  activated

  with <a href="/reference/p5/setCamera">setCamera()</a>.</p>

  <p>Note: <code>p5.Camera</code>’s methods operate in two coordinate
  systems:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>The “world” coordinate system describes positions in terms of their

  relationship to the origin along the x-, y-, and z-axes. For example,

  calling <code>myCamera.setPosition()</code> places the camera in 3D space
  using

  "world" coordinates.</li>

  <li>The "local" coordinate system describes positions from the camera's point

  of view: left-right, up-down, and forward-backward. For example, calling

  <code>myCamera.move()</code> moves the camera along its own axes.</li>

  </ul>
