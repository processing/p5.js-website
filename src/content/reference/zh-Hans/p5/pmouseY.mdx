description: >
  <p>A <code>Number</code> system variable that tracks the mouse's previous
  vertical

  position.</p>

  <p>In 2D mode, <code>pmouseY</code> keeps track of the mouse's position
  relative to the

  top-left corner of the canvas. Its value is

  <a href="/reference/p5/mouseY">mouseY</a> from the previous frame. For
  example, if

  the mouse was 50 pixels from the top edge of the canvas during the last

  frame, then <code>pmouseY</code> will be 50.</p>

  <p>In WebGL mode, <code>pmouseY</code> keeps track of the mouse's position
  relative to the

  center of the canvas. For example, if the mouse was 50 pixels below the

  canvas' center during the last frame, then <code>pmouseY</code> will be
  50.</p>

  <p>If touch is used instead of the mouse, then <code>pmouseY</code> will hold
  the

  y-coordinate of the last touch point.</p>

  <p>Note: <code>pmouseY</code> is reset to the current <a
  href="/reference/p5/mouseY">mouseY</a>

  value at the start of each touch event.</p>
