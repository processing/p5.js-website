description: >
  <p>A <code>Number</code> system variable that tracks the mouse's previous
  horizontal

  position.</p>

  <p>In 2D mode, <code>pmouseX</code> keeps track of the mouse's position
  relative to the

  top-left corner of the canvas. Its value is

  <a href="/reference/p5/mouseX">mouseX</a> from the previous frame. For
  example, if

  the mouse was 50 pixels from the left edge of the canvas during the last

  frame, then <code>pmouseX</code> will be 50.</p>

  <p>In WebGL mode, <code>pmouseX</code> keeps track of the mouse's position
  relative to the

  center of the canvas. For example, if the mouse was 50 pixels to the right

  of the canvas' center during the last frame, then <code>pmouseX</code> will be
  50.</p>

  <p>If touch is used instead of the mouse, then <code>pmouseX</code> will hold
  the

  x-coordinate of the last touch point.</p>

  <p>Note: <code>pmouseX</code> is reset to the current <a
  href="/reference/p5/mouseX">mouseX</a>

  value at the start of each touch event.</p>
