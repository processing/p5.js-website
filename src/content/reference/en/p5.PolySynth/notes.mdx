  <p>An object that holds information about which notes have been played and
  which notes are currently being played. New notes are added as keys
  on the fly. While a note has been attacked, but not released, the value of the
  key is the audiovoice which is generating that note. When notes are released,
  the value of the key becomes undefined.</p>
