  <p>Replaces the components of a <a
  href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> that are very close to zero with
  zero.</p>

  <p>In computers, handling numbers with decimals can give slightly imprecise
  answers due to the way those numbers are represented.

  This can make it hard to check if a number is zero, as it may be close but not
  exactly zero.

  This method rounds very close numbers to zero to make those checks easier</p>
