description: >
  <p>Delay is an echo effect. It processes an existing sound source,

  and outputs a delayed version of that sound. The p5.Delay can

  produce different effects depending on the delayTime, feedback,

  filter, and type. In the example below, a feedback of 0.5 (the

  default value) will produce a looping delay that decreases in

  volume by 50% each repeat. A filter will cut out the high

  frequencies so that the delay does not sound as piercing as the

  original source.</p>

      <p>Add delay to an audio signal according to a set
      of delay parameters.</p>

  delayTime:
    description: |
      <p>Set the delay (echo) time, in seconds. Usually this value will be
      a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0.</p>

  feedback:
    description: >
      <p>Feedback occurs when Delay sends its signal back through its input

      in a loop. The feedback amount determines how much signal to send each

      time through the loop. A feedback greater than 1.0 is not desirable
      because

      it will increase the overall output each time through the loop,

      creating an infinite feedback loop. The default value is 0.5</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.Delay/feedback
  filter:
    description: |
      <p>Set a lowpass filter frequency for the delay. A lowpass filter
      will cut off any frequencies higher than the filter frequency.</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.Delay/filter
  setType:
    description: |
      <p>Choose a preset type of delay. 'pingPong' bounces the signal
      from the left to the right channel to produce a stereo effect.
      Any other parameter will revert to the default delay setting.</p>
