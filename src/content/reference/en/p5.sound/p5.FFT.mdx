  <p>FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is an analysis algorithm that
  isolates individual
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_frequency">
  audio frequencies</a> within a waveform.</p>

  <p>Once instantiated, a p5.FFT object can return an array based on
  two types of analyses: <br> • <code>FFT.waveform()</code> computes
  amplitude values along the time domain. The array indices correspond
  to samples across a brief moment in time. Each value represents
  amplitude of the waveform at that sample of time.<br>
  • <code>FFT.analyze() </code> computes amplitude values along the
  frequency domain. The array indices correspond to frequencies (i.e.
  pitches), from the lowest to the highest that humans can hear. Each
  value represents amplitude at that slice of the frequency spectrum.
  Use with <code>getEnergy()</code> to measure amplitude at specific
  frequencies, or within a range of frequencies. </br></br></p>

  <p>FFT analyzes a very short snapshot of sound called a sample
  buffer. It returns an array of amplitude measurements, referred
  to as <code>bins</code>. The array is 1024 bins long by default.
  You can change the bin array length, but it must be a power of 2
  between 16 and 1024 in order for the FFT algorithm to function
  correctly. The actual size of the FFT buffer is twice the
  number of bins, so given a standard sample rate, the buffer is
  2048/44100 seconds long.</p>

  setInput:
    description: |
      <p>Set the input source for the FFT analysis. If no source is
      provided, FFT will analyze all sound in the sketch.</p>
    path: p5.FFT/setInput
  waveform:
    description: >
      <p>Returns an array of amplitude values (between -1.0 and +1.0) that
      represent

      a snapshot of amplitude readings in a single buffer. Length will be

      equal to bins (defaults to 1024). Can be used to draw the waveform

      of a sound.</p>
    path: p5.FFT/waveform
  analyze:
    description: |
      <p>Returns an array of amplitude values (between 0 and 255)
      across the frequency spectrum. Length is equal to FFT bins
      (1024 by default). The array indices correspond to frequencies
      (i.e. pitches), from the lowest to the highest that humans can
      hear. Each value represents amplitude at that slice of the
      frequency spectrum. Must be called prior to using
      <code>getEnergy()</code>.</p>
    path: p5.FFT/analyze
  getEnergy:
    description: |
      <p>Returns the amount of energy (volume) at a specific
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_frequency" target="_blank">
      frequency</a>, or the average amount of energy between two
      frequencies. Accepts Number(s) corresponding
      to frequency (in Hz), or a "string" corresponding to predefined
      frequency ranges ("bass", "lowMid", "mid", "highMid", "treble").
      Returns a range between 0 (no energy/volume at that frequency) and
      255 (maximum energy).
      <em>NOTE: analyze() must be called prior to getEnergy(). analyze()
      tells the FFT to analyze frequency data, and getEnergy() uses
      the results to determine the value at a specific frequency or
      range of frequencies.</em></p>
    path: p5.FFT/getEnergy
  getCentroid:
    description: |
      <p>Returns the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_centroid" target="_blank">
      spectral centroid</a> of the input signal.
      <em>NOTE: analyze() must be called prior to getCentroid(). Analyze()
      tells the FFT to analyze frequency data, and getCentroid() uses
      the results determine the spectral centroid.</em></p>
    path: p5.FFT/getCentroid
  smooth:
    description: |
      <p>Smooth FFT analysis by averaging with the last analysis frame.</p>
    path: p5.FFT/smooth
  linAverages:
    description: |
      <p>Returns an array of average amplitude values for a given number
      of frequency bands split equally. N defaults to 16.
      <em>NOTE: analyze() must be called prior to linAverages(). Analyze()
      tells the FFT to analyze frequency data, and linAverages() uses
      the results to group them into a smaller set of averages.</em></p>
    path: p5.FFT/linAverages
  logAverages:
    description: >
      <p>Returns an array of average amplitude values of the spectrum, for a
      given

      set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave_band"
      target="_blank">

      Octave Bands</a>

      <em>NOTE: analyze() must be called prior to logAverages(). Analyze()

      tells the FFT to analyze frequency data, and logAverages() uses

      the results to group them into a smaller set of averages.</em></p>
    path: p5.FFT/logAverages
  getOctaveBands:
    description: >
      <p>Calculates and Returns the 1/N

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave_band"
      target="_blank">Octave Bands</a>

      N defaults to 3 and minimum central frequency to 15.625Hz.

      (1/3 Octave Bands ~= 31 Frequency Bands)

      Setting fCtr0 to a central value of a higher octave will ignore the lower
      bands

      and produce less frequency groups.</p>
