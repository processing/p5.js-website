description: |
  <p>A MonoSynth is used as a single voice for sound synthesis.
  This is a class to be used in conjunction with the PolySynth
  class. Custom synthetisers should be built inheriting from
  this class.</p>

example:
  - |-

    <div><code>
    let monoSynth;

    function setup() {
      let cnv = createCanvas(100, 100);
      cnv.mousePressed(playSynth);
      background(220);
      textAlign(CENTER);
      text('tap to play', width/2, height/2);

      monoSynth = new p5.MonoSynth();
    }

    function playSynth() {
      userStartAudio();

      let note = random(['Fb4', 'G4']);
      // note velocity (volume, from 0 to 1)
      let velocity = random();
      // time from now (in seconds)
      let time = 0;
      // note duration (in seconds)
      let dur = 1/6;

      monoSynth.play(note, velocity, time, dur);
    }
    </code></div>
methods:
  play:
    description: |
      <p>Play tells the MonoSynth to start playing a note. This method schedules
      the calling of .triggerAttack and .triggerRelease.</p>
    path: p5.MonoSynth/play
  triggerAttack:
    description: |
      <p>Trigger the Attack, and Decay portion of the Envelope.
      Similar to holding down a key on a piano, but it will
      hold the sustain level until you let go.</p>
    path: p5.MonoSynth/triggerAttack
  triggerRelease:
    description: |
      <p>Trigger the release of the Envelope. This is similar to releasing
      the key on a piano and letting the sound fade according to the
      release level and release time.</p>
