  <p>A phrase is a pattern of musical events over time, i.e.
  a series of notes and rests.</p>

  <p>Phrases must be added to a p5.Part for playback, and
  each part can play multiple phrases at the same time.
  For example, one Phrase might be a kick drum, another
  could be a snare, and another could be the bassline.</p>

  <p>The first parameter is a name so that the phrase can be
  modified or deleted later. The callback is a a function that
  this phrase will call at every stepâ€”for example it might be
  called <code>playNote(value){}</code>. The array determines
  which value is passed into the callback at each step of the
  phrase. It can be numbers, an object with multiple numbers,
  or a zero (0) indicates a rest so the callback won't be called).</p>

      <p>The name of a function that this phrase
                                 will call. Typically it will play a sound,
                                 and accept two parameters: a time at which
                                 to play the sound (in seconds from now),
                                 and a value from the sequence array. The
                                 time should be passed into the play() or
                                 start() method to ensure precision.</p>

      <p>Array of values to pass into the callback
      at each step of the phrase. Depending on the callback
      function's requirements, these values may be numbers,
      strings, or an object with multiple parameters.
