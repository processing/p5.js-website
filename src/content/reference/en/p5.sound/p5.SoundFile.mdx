  <p>SoundFile object with a path to a file.</p>

  <p>The p5.SoundFile may not be available immediately because
  it loads the file information asynchronously.</p>

  <p>To do something with the sound as soon as it loads
  pass the name of a function as the second parameter.</p>

  <p>Only one file path is required. However, audio file formats
  (i.e. mp3, ogg, wav and m4a/aac) are not supported by all
  web browsers. If you want to ensure compatability, instead of a single
  file path, you may include an Array of filepaths, and the browser will
  choose a format that works.</p>

                                   an array. Alternately, accepts an object
                                   from the HTML5 File API, or a p5.File.</p>

  playMode:
    description: |
      <p>p5.SoundFile has two play modes: <code>restart</code> and
      <code>sustain</code>. Play Mode determines what happens to a
      p5.SoundFile if it is triggered while in the middle of playback.
      In sustain mode, playback will continue simultaneous to the
      new playback. In restart mode, play() will stop playback
      and start over. With untilDone, a sound will play only if it's
      not already playing. Sustain is the default mode.</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.SoundFile/playMode
  pause:
    description: |
      <p>Pauses a file that is currently playing. If the file is not
      playing, then nothing will happen.</p>
      <p>After pausing, .play() will resume from the paused
      position.
      If p5.SoundFile had been set to loop before it was paused,
      it will continue to loop after it is unpaused with .play().</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.SoundFile/pause
  loop:
    description: |
      <p>Loop the p5.SoundFile. Accepts optional parameters to set the
      playback rate, playback volume, loopStart, loopEnd.</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.SoundFile/loop
  setLoop:
    description: |
      <p>Set a p5.SoundFile's looping flag to true or false. If the sound
      is currently playing, this change will take effect when it
      reaches the end of the current playback.</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.SoundFile/setLoop
  isLooping:
    description: >
      <p>Returns 'true' if a p5.SoundFile is currently looping and playing,
      'false' if not.</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.SoundFile/isLooping
  isPlaying:
    description: |
      <p>Returns true if a p5.SoundFile is playing, false if not (i.e.
      paused or stopped).</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.SoundFile/isPlaying
  isPaused:

  pan:
    description: |
      <p>Set the stereo panning of a p5.sound object to
      a floating point number between -1.0 (left) and 1.0 (right).
      Default is 0.0 (center).</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.SoundFile/pan
  getPan:
    description: |
      <p>Returns the current stereo pan position (-1.0 to 1.0)</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.SoundFile/getPan
  rate:
    description: >
      <p>Set the playback rate of a sound file. Will change the speed and the
      pitch.

      Values less than zero will reverse the audio buffer.</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.SoundFile/rate
  setVolume:
    description: |
      <p>Multiply the output volume (amplitude) of a sound file
      between 0.0 (silence) and 1.0 (full volume).
      1.0 is the maximum amplitude of a digital sound, so multiplying
      by greater than 1.0 may cause digital distortion. To
      fade, provide a <code>rampTime</code> parameter. For more
      complex fades, see the Envelope class.</p>
      <p>Alternately, you can pass in a signal source such as an
      oscillator to modulate the amplitude with an audio signal.</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.SoundFile/setVolume
  duration:
    description: |
      <p>Returns the duration of a sound file in seconds.</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.SoundFile/duration
  currentTime:
    description: >
      <p>Return the current position of the p5.SoundFile playhead, in seconds.

      Time is relative to the normal buffer direction, so if
      <code>reverseBuffer</code>

      has been called, currentTime will count backwards.</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.SoundFile/currentTime
  jump:
    description: >
      <p>Move the playhead of a soundfile that is currently playing to a

      new position and a new duration, in seconds.

      If none are given, will reset the file to play entire duration

      from start to finish. To set the position of a soundfile that is

      not currently playing, use the <code>play</code> or <code>loop</code>
      methods.</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.SoundFile/jump
  channels:
    description: |
      <p>Return the number of channels in a sound file.
      For example, Mono = 1, Stereo = 2.</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.SoundFile/channels
  sampleRate:
    description: |
      <p>Return the sample rate of the sound file.</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.SoundFile/sampleRate
  frames:
    description: |
      <p>Return the number of samples in a sound file.
      Equal to sampleRate * duration.</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.SoundFile/frames
  getPeaks:
    description: |
      <p>Returns an array of amplitude peaks in a p5.SoundFile that can be
      used to draw a static waveform. Scans through the p5.SoundFile's
      audio buffer to find the greatest amplitudes. Accepts one
      parameter, 'length', which determines size of the array.
      Larger arrays result in more precise waveform visualizations.</p>
      <p>Inspired by Wavesurfer.js.</p>

  reverseBuffer:
    description: |
      <p>Reverses the p5.SoundFile's buffer source.
      Playback must be handled separately (see example).</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.SoundFile/reverseBuffer
  onended:
    description: |
      <p>Schedule an event to be called when the soundfile
      reaches the end of a buffer. If the soundfile is
      playing through once, this will be called when it
      ends. If it is looping, it will be called when
      stop is called.</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.SoundFile/onended
  connect:
    description: |
      <p>Connects the output of a p5sound object to input of another
      p5.sound object. For example, you may connect a p5.SoundFile to an
      FFT or an Effect. If no parameter is given, it will connect to
      the main output. Most p5sound objects connect to the master
      output when they are created.</p>

  addCue:
    description: |
      <p>Schedule events to trigger every time a MediaElement
      (audio/video) reaches a playback cue point.</p>
      <p>Accepts a callback function, a time (in seconds) at which to trigger
      the callback, and an optional parameter for the callback.</p>
      <p>Time will be passed as the first parameter to the callback function,
