description: >
  <p>Compressor is an audio effect class that performs dynamics compression

  on an audio input source. This is a very commonly used technique in music

  and sound production. Compression creates an overall louder, richer,

  and fuller sound by lowering the volume of louds and raising that of softs.

  Compression can be used to avoid clipping (sound distortion due to

  peaks in volume) and is especially useful when many sounds are played

  at once. Compression can be used on indivudal sound sources in addition

  to the main output.</p>
