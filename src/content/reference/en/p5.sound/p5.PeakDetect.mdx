  <p>PeakDetect works in conjunction with p5.FFT to

  look for onsets in some or all of the frequency spectrum.

  </p>

  <p>

  To use p5.PeakDetect, call <code>update</code> in the draw loop

  and pass in a p5.FFT object.

  </p>

  <p>

  You can listen for a specific part of the frequency spectrum by

  setting the range between <code>freq1</code> and <code>freq2</code>.

  </p>


  <p><code>threshold</code> is the threshold for detecting a peak,

  scaled between 0 and 1. It is logarithmic, so 0.1 is half as loud

  as 1.0.</p>


  <p>

  The update method is meant to be run in the draw loop, and

  <b>frames</b> determines how many loops must pass before

  another peak can be detected.

  For example, if the frameRate() = 60, you could detect the beat of a

  120 beat-per-minute song with this equation:

  <code> framesPerPeak = 60 / (estimatedBPM / 60 );</code>

  </p>
