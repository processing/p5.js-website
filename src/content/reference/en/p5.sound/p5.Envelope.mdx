methods:
  set:
    description: |
      <p>Reset the envelope with a series of time/value pairs.</p>

  setADSR:
    description: 'Sets the attack, decay, sustain, and release times of the envelope.'
    path: p5.Envelope/setADSR
  setRange:
    description: |
      <p>Set max (attackLevel) and min (releaseLevel) of envelope.</p>

  setInput:
    description: ''
    path: p5.Envelope/setInput
  setExp:
    description: |
      <p>Set whether the envelope ramp is linear (default) or exponential.
      Exponential ramps can be useful because we perceive amplitude
      and frequency logarithmically.</p>

  play:
    description: Trigger the envelope and release it after the sustain time.
    path: p5.Envelope/play
  triggerAttack:
    description: >-
      Trigger the Attack, and Decay portion of the Envelope. Similar to holding

      down a key on a piano, but it will hold the sustain level until you let
      go.
    path: p5.Envelope/triggerAttack
  triggerRelease:
    description: |-
      Trigger the Release of the envelope. Similar to releasing the key on 
      a piano and letting the sound fade according to the release level and 
      release time.
    path: p5.Envelope/triggerRelease
  ramp:
    description: >
      <p>Exponentially ramp to a value using the first two

      values from <code><a
      href="/reference/p5.Envelope/setADSR/">setADSR(attackTime,
      decayTime)</a></code>

      as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_time_constant/">

      time constants</a> for simple exponential ramps.

      If the value is higher than current value, it uses attackTime,

      while a decrease uses decayTime.</p>

  add:
    description: |
      <p>Add a value to the p5.Oscillator's output amplitude,
      and return the oscillator. Calling this method
      again will override the initial add() with new values.</p>
    path: p5.Envelope/add
  mult:
    description: |
      <p>Multiply the p5.Envelope's output amplitude
      by a fixed value. Calling this method
      again will override the initial mult() with new values.</p>
    path: p5.Envelope/mult
  scale:
    description: |
      <p>Scale this envelope's amplitude values to a given
      range, and return the envelope. Calling this method
      again will override the initial scale() with new values.</p>
