description: >-
  <p>Get audio from an input, i.e. your computer's microphone.</p>


  <p>Turn the mic on/off with the start() and stop() methods. When the mic

  is on, its volume can be measured with getLevel or by connecting an

  FFT object.</p>


  <p>If you want to hear the AudioIn, use the .connect() method.

  AudioIn does not connect to p5.sound output by default to prevent

  feedback.</p>


  <p><em>Note: This uses the <a href="http://caniuse.com/stream/">getUserMedia/

  Stream</a> API, which is not supported by certain browsers. Access in Chrome
  browser

  is limited to localhost and https, but access over http may be
  limited.</em></p>

    description: |
      <p>A function to call if there is an error
                                        accessing the AudioIn. For example,
                                        Safari and iOS devices do not
                                        currently allow microphone access.</p>

example:

    <div><code>
    let mic;

     function setup(){
      let cnv = createCanvas(100, 100);
      cnv.mousePressed(userStartAudio);
      textAlign(CENTER);
      mic = new p5.AudioIn();
      mic.start();
    }

    function draw(){

      micLevel = mic.getLevel();
      let y = height - micLevel * height;
      ellipse(width/2, y, 10, 10);
    }
    </code></div>
methods:
  start:
    description: |
      <p>Start processing audio input. This enables the use of other
      AudioIn methods like getLevel(). Note that by default, AudioIn
      is not connected to p5.sound's output. So you won't hear
      anything unless you use the connect() method.<br/></p>
      <p>Certain browsers limit access to the user's microphone. For example,
      Chrome only allows access from localhost and over https. For this reason,
      you may want to include an errorCallbackâ€”a function that is called in case
      the browser won't provide mic access.</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.AudioIn/start
  stop:
    description: |
      <p>Turn the AudioIn off. If the AudioIn is stopped, it cannot getLevel().
      If re-starting, the user may be prompted for permission access.</p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.AudioIn/stop
  connect:
    description: |
      <p>Connect to an audio unit. If no parameter is provided, will
      connect to the main output (i.e. your speakers).<br/></p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.AudioIn/connect
  disconnect:
    description: |
      <p>Disconnect the AudioIn from all audio units. For example, if
      connect() had been called, disconnect() will stop sending
      signal to your speakers.<br/></p>
    path: src\content\reference\en\p5.AudioIn/disconnect
  getLevel:
    description: |
      <p>Read the Amplitude (volume level) of an AudioIn. The AudioIn
      class contains its own instance of the Amplitude class to help
      make it easy to get a microphone's volume level. Accepts an
      optional smoothing value (0.0 < 1.0). <em>NOTE: AudioIn must
      .start() before using .getLevel().</em><br/></p>

  getSources:

  setSource:
