  <p>If you have used <code>.addImpulse()</code> to add multiple impulses
  to a p5.Convolver, then you can use this method to toggle between
  the items in the <code>.impulses</code> Array. Accepts a parameter
  to identify which impulse you wish to use, identified either by its
  original filename (String) or by its position in the <code>.impulses
  </code> Array (Number).<br/>
  You can access the objects in the .impulses Array directly. Each
  Object has two attributes: an <code>.audioBuffer</code> (type:
  Web Audio <a href="
  http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#the-audiobuffer-interface">
  AudioBuffer)</a> and a <code>.name</code>, a String that corresponds
  with the original filename.</p>
