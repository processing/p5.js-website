  <p>Sets a perspective projection for the camera.</p>

  <p>In a perspective projection, shapes that are further from the camera appear

  smaller than shapes that are near the camera. This technique, called

  foreshortening, creates realistic 3D scenes. It’s applied by default in new

  <code>p5.Camera</code> objects.</p>

  <p><code>myCamera.perspective()</code> changes the camera’s perspective by
  changing its

  viewing frustum. The frustum is the volume of space that’s visible to the

  camera. The frustum’s shape is a pyramid with its top cut off. The camera

  is placed where the top of the pyramid should be and points towards the

  base of the pyramid. It views everything within the frustum.</p>

  <p>The first parameter, <code>fovy</code>, is the camera’s vertical field of
  view. It’s

  an angle that describes how tall or narrow a view the camera has. For

  example, calling <code>myCamera.perspective(0.5)</code> sets the camera’s
  vertical

  field of view to 0.5 radians. By default, <code>fovy</code> is calculated
  based on the

  sketch’s height and the camera’s default z-coordinate, which is 800. The

  formula for the default <code>fovy</code> is <code>2 * atan(height / 2 /
  800)</code>.</p>

  <p>The second parameter, <code>aspect</code>, is the camera’s aspect ratio.
  It’s a number

  that describes the ratio of the top plane’s width to its height. For

  example, calling <code>myCamera.perspective(0.5, 1.5)</code> sets the camera’s
  field

  of view to 0.5 radians and aspect ratio to 1.5, which would make shapes

  appear thinner on a square canvas. By default, <code>aspect</code> is set to

  <code>width / height</code>.</p>

  <p>The third parameter, <code>near</code>, is the distance from the camera to
  the near

  plane. For example, calling <code>myCamera.perspective(0.5, 1.5, 100)</code>
  sets the

  camera’s field of view to 0.5 radians, its aspect ratio to 1.5, and places

  the near plane 100 pixels from the camera. Any shapes drawn less than 100

  pixels from the camera won’t be visible. By default, <code>near</code> is set
  to

  <code>0.1 * 800</code>, which is 1/10th the default distance between the
  camera and

  the origin.</p>

  <p>The fourth parameter, <code>far</code>, is the distance from the camera to
  the far

  plane. For example, calling <code>myCamera.perspective(0.5, 1.5, 100,
  10000)</code>

  sets the camera’s field of view to 0.5 radians, its aspect ratio to 1.5,

  places the near plane 100 pixels from the camera, and places the far plane

  10,000 pixels from the camera. Any shapes drawn more than 10,000 pixels

  from the camera won’t be visible. By default, <code>far</code> is set to
  <code>10 * 800</code>,

  which is 10 times the default distance between the camera and the origin.</p>
