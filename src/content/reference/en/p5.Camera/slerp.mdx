  <p>Sets the camera’s position and orientation to values that are in-between

  those of two other cameras.</p>

  <p><code>myCamera.slerp()</code> uses spherical linear interpolation to
  calculate a

  position and orientation that’s in-between two other cameras. Doing so is

  helpful for transitioning smoothly between two perspectives.</p>

  <p>The first two parameters, <code>cam0</code> and <code>cam1</code>, are the
  <code>p5.Camera</code> objects

  that should be used to set the current camera.</p>

  <p>The third parameter, <code>amt</code>, is the amount to interpolate between
  <code>cam0</code> and

  <code>cam1</code>. 0.0 keeps the camera’s position and orientation equal to
  <code>cam0</code>’s,

  0.5 sets them halfway between <code>cam0</code>’s and <code>cam1</code>’s ,
  and 1.0 sets the

  position and orientation equal to <code>cam1</code>’s.</p>

  <p>For example, calling <code>myCamera.slerp(cam0, cam1, 0.1)</code> sets
  cam’s position

  and orientation very close to <code>cam0</code>’s. Calling

  <code>myCamera.slerp(cam0, cam1, 0.9)</code> sets cam’s position and
  orientation very

  close to <code>cam1</code>’s.</p>

  <p>Note: All of the cameras must use the same projection.</p>
