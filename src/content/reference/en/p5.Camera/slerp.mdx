  <p>For the cameras cam0 and cam1 with the given arguments, their view are
  combined

  with the parameter amt that represents the quantity, and the obtained view is
  applied.

  For example, if cam0 is looking straight ahead and cam1 is looking straight

  to the right and amt is 0.5, the applied camera will look to the halfway

  between front and right.

  If the applied camera is active, the applied result will be reflected on the
  screen.

  When applying this function, all cameras involved must have exactly the same
  projection

  settings. For example, if one is perspective, ortho, frustum, the other two
  must also be

  perspective, ortho, frustum respectively. However, if all cameras have ortho
  settings,

  interpolation is possible if the ratios of left, right, top and bottom are
  equal to each other.

  For example, when it is changed by orbitControl().</p>

  There is a camera, drawing a cube. The camera can be moved freely with

  orbitControl(). Double-click to smoothly return the camera to its initial
  state.

  The camera cannot be moved during that time.
