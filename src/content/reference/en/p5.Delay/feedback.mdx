  <p>Feedback occurs when Delay sends its signal back through its input
  in a loop. The feedback amount determines how much signal to send each
  time through the loop. A feedback greater than 1.0 is not desirable because
  it will increase the overall output each time through the loop,
  creating an infinite feedback loop. The default value is 0.5</p>
