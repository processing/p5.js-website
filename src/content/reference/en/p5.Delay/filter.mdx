      <p>Resonance of the filter frequency
                                  cutoff, or an object (i.e. a p5.Oscillator)
                                  that can be used to modulate this parameter.
                                  High numbers (i.e. 15) will produce a resonance,
                                  low numbers (i.e. .2) will produce a slope.</p>
