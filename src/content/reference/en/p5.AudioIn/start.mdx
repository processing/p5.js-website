  <p>Start processing audio input. This enables the use of other
  AudioIn methods like getLevel(). Note that by default, AudioIn
  is not connected to p5.sound's output. So you won't hear
  anything unless you use the connect() method.<br/></p>
  <p>Certain browsers limit access to the user's microphone. For example,
  Chrome only allows access from localhost and over https. For this reason,
  you may want to include an errorCallbackâ€”a function that is called in case
  the browser won't provide mic access.</p>
