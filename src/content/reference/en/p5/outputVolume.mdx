description: |-
  <p>Scale the output of all sound in this sketch</p>
  Scaled between 0.0 (silence) and 1.0 (full volume).
  1.0 is the maximum amplitude of a digital sound, so multiplying
  by greater than 1.0 may cause digital distortion. To
  fade, provide a <code>rampTime</code> parameter. For more
  complex fades, see the Envelope class.

  <p>Alternately, you can pass in a signal source such as an
  oscillator to modulate the amplitude with an audio signal.</p>
  <p><b>How This Works</b>: When you load the p5.sound module, it
  creates a single instance of p5sound. All sound objects in this
  module output to p5sound before reaching your computer's output.
  So if you change the amplitude of p5sound, it impacts all of the
  sound in this module.</p>
