description: >
  <p>Given the x or y co-ordinate values of control and anchor points of a
  bezier

  curve, it evaluates the x or y coordinate of the bezier at position t. The

  parameters a and d are the x or y coordinates of first and last points on the

  curve while b and c are of the control points.The final parameter t is the

  position of the resultant point which is given between 0 and 1.

  This can be done once with the x coordinates and a second time

  with the y coordinates to get the location of a bezier curve at t.</p>
