description: >
  <p>A class to describe a color.</p>

  <p>Each <code>p5.Color</code> object stores the color mode

  and level maxes that were active during its construction. These values are

  used to interpret the arguments passed to the object's constructor. They

  also determine output formatting such as when

  <a href="/reference/p5/saturation">saturation()</a> is called.</p>

  <p>Color is stored internally as an array of ideal RGBA values in floating

  point form, normalized from 0 to 1. These values are used to calculate the

  closest screen colors, which are RGBA levels from 0 to 255. Screen colors

  are sent to the renderer.</p>

  <p>When different color representations are calculated, the results are cached

  for performance. These values are normalized, floating-point numbers.</p>

  <p>Note: <a href="/reference/p5/color">color()</a> is the recommended way to
  create an

  instance of this class.</p>

      <p>Returns the color formatted as a <code>String</code>.</p>

      <p>Calling <code>myColor.toString()</code> can be useful for debugging, as
      in

      <code>print(myColor.toString())</code>. It's also helpful for using p5.js
      with other

      libraries.</p>

      <p>The parameter, <code>format</code>, is optional. If a format string is
      passed, as in

      <code>myColor.toString('#rrggbb')</code>, it will determine how the color
      string is

      formatted. By default, color strings are formatted as <code>'rgba(r, g, b,
      a)'</code>.</p>
