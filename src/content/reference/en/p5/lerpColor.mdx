  <p>Blends two colors to find a third color between them.</p>

  <p>The <code>amt</code> parameter specifies the amount to interpolate between
  the two

  values. 0 is equal to the first color, 0.1 is very near the first color,

  0.5 is halfway between the two colors, and so on. Negative numbers are set

  to 0. Numbers greater than 1 are set to 1. This differs from the behavior of

  <a href="/reference/lerp/">lerp</a>. It's necessary because numbers outside of
  the

  interval [0, 1] will produce strange and unexpected colors.</p>

  <p>The way that colors are interpolated depends on the current

  <a href="/reference/colorMode/">colorMode()</a>.</p>
