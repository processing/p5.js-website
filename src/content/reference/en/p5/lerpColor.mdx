description: >
  <p>Blends two colors to find a third color between them. The <code>amt</code>
  parameter

  specifies the amount to interpolate between the two values. 0 is equal to

  the first color, 0.1 is very near the first color, 0.5 is halfway between

  the two colors, and so on. Negative numbers are set to 0. Numbers greater

  than 1 are set to 1. This differs from the behavior of

  <a href="#/lerp">lerp</a>. It's necessary because numbers outside of the

  interval [0, 1] will produce strange and unexpected colors.</p>

  <p>The way that colors are interpolated depends on the current

  <a href="#/colorMode">colorMode()</a>.</p>
