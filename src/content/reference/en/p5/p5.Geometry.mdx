  <p>A class to describe a 3D shape.</p>

  <p>Each <code>p5.Geometry</code> object represents a 3D shape as a set of
  connected

  points called <em>vertices</em>. All 3D shapes are made by connecting vertices
  to

  form triangles that are stitched together. Each triangular patch on the

  geometry's surface is called a <em>face</em>. The geometry stores information

  about its vertices and faces for use with effects such as lighting and

  texture mapping.</p>

  <p>The first parameter, <code>detailX</code>, is optional. If a number is
  passed, as in

  <code>new p5.Geometry(24)</code>, it sets the number of triangle subdivisions
  to use

  along the geometry's x-axis. By default, <code>detailX</code> is 1.</p>

  <p>The second parameter, <code>detailY</code>, is also optional. If a number
  is passed,

  as in <code>new p5.Geometry(24, 16)</code>, it sets the number of triangle

  subdivisions to use along the geometry's y-axis. By default,
  <code>detailX</code> is

  1.</p>

  <p>The third parameter, <code>callback</code>, is also optional. If a function
  is passed,

  as in <code>new p5.Geometry(24, 16, createShape)</code>, it will be called
  once to add

  vertices to the new 3D shape.</p>

      <p><code>p5.Geometry</code> objects can be created with "internal colors"
      assigned to

      vertices or the entire shape. When a geometry has internal colors,

      <a href="/reference/p5/fill/">fill()</a> has no effect. Calling

      <code>myGeometry.clearColors()</code> allows the

      <a href="/reference/p5/fill/">fill()</a> function to apply color to the
      geometry.</p>

      This way, you can use the 3D shapes you create in p5.js in other software

      for rendering, animation, 3D printing, or more.</p>

      <p>The exported .obj file will include the faces and vertices of the
      <code>p5.Geometry</code>,

      as well as its texture coordinates and normals, if it has them.</p>

  flipU:
    description: >
      <p>Flips the geometry’s texture u-coordinates.</p>

      <p>In order for <a href="/reference/p5/texture/">texture()</a> to work,
      the geometry

      needs a way to map the points on its surface to the pixels in a
      rectangular

      image that's used as a texture. The geometry's vertex at coordinates

      <code>(x, y, z)</code> maps to the texture image's pixel at coordinates
      <code>(u, v)</code>.</p>

      <p>The <a href="/reference/p5.Geometry/uvs/">myGeometry.uvs</a> array
      stores the

      <code>(u, v)</code> coordinates for each vertex in the order it was added
      to the

      geometry. Calling <code>myGeometry.flipU()</code> flips a geometry's
      u-coordinates

      so that the texture appears mirrored horizontally.</p>

      <p>For example, a plane's four vertices are added clockwise starting from
      the

      top-left corner. Here's how calling <code>myGeometry.flipU()</code> would
      change a

      plane's texture coordinates:</p>

      the math needed to

      define each face based on the distances between vertices.</p>

      <p>The geometry's vertices are stored as <a
      href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a>

      objects in the <a
      href="/reference/p5.Geometry/vertices/">myGeometry.vertices</a>

      array. The geometry's first vertex is the

      <a href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> object at

      its second vertex is <code>myGeometry.vertices[1]</code>, its third vertex
      is

      <code>myGeometry.vertices[2]</code>, and so on.</p>

      <p>Calling <code>myGeometry.computeFaces()</code> fills the

      three-element

      arrays that list the vertices that form each face. For example, a geometry

      <code>[[0, 1, 2], [2, 1, 3]]</code>. The first face,
      <code>myGeometry.faces[0]</code>, is the

      array <code>[0, 1, 2]</code> because it's formed by connecting

      <code>myGeometry.computeNormals()</code> performs the

      and other effects.</p>

      <p>A face's orientation is defined by its <em>normal vector</em> which
      points out

      of the face and is normal (perpendicular) to the surface. Calling

      <code>myGeometry.computeNormals()</code> first calculates each face's
      normal vector.

      Then it calculates the normal vector for each vertex by averaging the

      normal vectors of the faces surrounding the vertex. The vertex normals

      are stored as <a href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> objects in
      the

      <a
      href="/reference/p5.Geometry/vertexNormals/">myGeometry.vertexNormals</a>
      array.</p>

      <p>The first parameter, <code>shadingType</code>, is optional. Passing the
      constant

      <code>FLAT</code>, as in <code>myGeometry.computeNormals(FLAT)</code>,
      provides neighboring

      faces with their own copies of the vertices they share. Surfaces appear

      tiled with flat shading. Passing the constant <code>SMOOTH</code>, as in

      <code>myGeometry.computeNormals(SMOOTH)</code>, makes neighboring faces
      reuse their

      shared vertices. Surfaces appear smoother with smooth shading. By

      default, <code>shadingType</code> is <code>FLAT</code>.</p>

      <p>The second parameter, <code>options</code>, is also optional. If an
      object with a

      <code>roundToPrecision</code> property is passed, as in

      <code>myGeometry.computeNormals(SMOOTH, { roundToPrecision: 5 })</code>,
      it sets the

      for a

      rectangle would be the two-dimensional array <code>[[0, 1, 2], [2, 1,
      3]]</code>.

      The first face, <code>myGeometry.faces[0]</code>, is the array <code>[0,
      1, 2]</code> because

      it's formed by connecting <code>myGeometry.vertices[0]</code>,

      <code>myGeometry.vertices[1]</code>,and
      <code>myGeometry.vertices[2]</code>. The second face,

      <code>myGeometry.faces[1]</code>, is the array <code>[2, 1, 3]</code>
      because it's formed by

      connecting <code>myGeometry.vertices[2]</code>,
      <code>myGeometry.vertices[1]</code>,and

      <code>myGeometry.vertices[3]</code>.</p>

      <p>An array that lists the texture coordinates for each of the geometry's

      vertices.</p>

      <p>In order for <a href="/reference/p5/texture/">texture()</a> to work,
      the geometry

      needs a way to map the points on its surface to the pixels in a

      rectangular image that's used as a texture. The geometry's vertex at

      coordinates <code>(x, y, z)</code> maps to the texture image's pixel at
      coordinates

      <code>(u, v)</code>.</p>

      <p>The <code>myGeometry.uvs</code> array stores the <code>(u, v)</code>
      coordinates for each

      vertex in the order it was added to the geometry. For example, the

      first vertex, <code>myGeometry.vertices[0]</code>, has its <code>(u,
      v)</code> coordinates

      stored at <code>myGeometry.uvs[0]</code> and
      <code>myGeometry.uvs[1]</code>.</p>
