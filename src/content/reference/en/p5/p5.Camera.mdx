  <p>This class describes a camera for use in p5's

  <a
  href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Getting-started-with-WebGL-in-p5">

  WebGL mode</a>. It contains camera position, orientation, and projection

  information necessary for rendering a 3D scene.</p>

  <p>New p5.Camera objects can be made through the

  <a href="./createCamera">createCamera()</a> function and controlled through

  the methods described below. A camera created in this way will use a default

  position in the scene and a default perspective projection until these

  properties are changed through the various methods available. It is possible

  to create multiple cameras, in which case the current camera

  can be set through the <a href="./setCamera">setCamera()</a> method.</p>

  <p>Note:

  The methods below operate in two coordinate systems: the 'world' coordinate

  system describe positions in terms of their relationship to the origin along

  the X, Y and Z axes whereas the camera's 'local' coordinate system

  describes positions from the camera's point of view: left-right, up-down,

  and forward-backward. The <a href="#/p5.Camera/move">move()</a> method,

  for instance, moves the camera along its own axes, whereas the

  <a href="#/p5.Camera/setPosition">setPosition()</a>

  method sets the camera's position in world-space.</p>

  <p>The camera object properties

  <code>eyeX, eyeY, eyeZ, centerX, centerY, centerZ, upX, upY, upZ</code>

  which describes camera position, orientation, and projection

  are also accessible via the camera object generated using

  <a href="./createCamera">createCamera()</a></p>
