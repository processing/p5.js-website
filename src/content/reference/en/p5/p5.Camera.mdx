  <p>A class to describe a camera for viewing a 3D sketch.</p>

  <p>Each <code>p5.Camera</code> object represents a camera that views a section
  of 3D

  space. It stores information about the camera’s position, orientation, and

  projection.</p>

  <p>In WebGL mode, the default camera is a <code>p5.Camera</code> object that
  can be

  controlled with the <a href="/reference/p5/camera/">camera()</a>,

  <a href="/reference/p5/perspective/">perspective()</a>,

  <a href="/reference/p5/ortho/">ortho()</a>, and

  <a href="/reference/p5/frustum/">frustum()</a> functions. Additional cameras
  can be

  created with <a href="/reference/p5/createCamera/">createCamera()</a> and
  activated

  with <a href="/reference/p5/setCamera/">setCamera()</a>.</p>

  <p>Note: <code>p5.Camera</code>’s methods operate in two coordinate
  systems:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>The “world” coordinate system describes positions in terms of their

  relationship to the origin along the x-, y-, and z-axes. For example,

  calling <code>myCamera.setPosition()</code> places the camera in 3D space
  using

  "world" coordinates.</li>

  <li>The "local" coordinate system describes positions from the camera's point

  of view: left-right, up-down, and forward-backward. For example, calling

  <code>myCamera.move()</code> moves the camera along its own axes.</li>

methods:
  perspective:
    description: >
      <p>Sets a perspective projection for the camera.</p>

      <p>In a perspective projection, shapes that are further from the camera
      appear

      smaller than shapes that are near the camera. This technique, called

      foreshortening, creates realistic 3D scenes. It’s applied by default in
      new

      <code>p5.Camera</code> objects.</p>

      <p><code>myCamera.perspective()</code> changes the camera’s perspective by
      changing its

      viewing frustum. The frustum is the volume of space that’s visible to the

      camera. The frustum’s shape is a pyramid with its top cut off. The camera

      is placed where the top of the pyramid should be and points towards the

      base of the pyramid. It views everything within the frustum.</p>

      <p>The first parameter, <code>fovy</code>, is the camera’s vertical field
      of view. It’s

      an angle that describes how tall or narrow a view the camera has. For

      example, calling <code>myCamera.perspective(0.5)</code> sets the camera’s
      vertical

      field of view to 0.5 radians. By default, <code>fovy</code> is calculated
      based on the

      sketch’s height and the camera’s default z-coordinate, which is 800. The

      formula for the default <code>fovy</code> is <code>2 * atan(height / 2 /
      800)</code>.</p>

      <p>The second parameter, <code>aspect</code>, is the camera’s aspect
      ratio. It’s a number

      that describes the ratio of the top plane’s width to its height. For

      example, calling <code>myCamera.perspective(0.5, 1.5)</code> sets the
      camera’s field

      of view to 0.5 radians and aspect ratio to 1.5, which would make shapes

      appear thinner on a square canvas. By default, <code>aspect</code> is set
      to

      <code>width / height</code>.</p>

      <p>The third parameter, <code>near</code>, is the distance from the camera
      to the near

      plane. For example, calling <code>myCamera.perspective(0.5, 1.5,
      100)</code> sets the

      camera’s field of view to 0.5 radians, its aspect ratio to 1.5, and places

      the near plane 100 pixels from the camera. Any shapes drawn less than 100

      pixels from the camera won’t be visible. By default, <code>near</code> is
      set to

      <code>0.1 * 800</code>, which is 1/10th the default distance between the
      camera and

      the origin.</p>

      <p>The fourth parameter, <code>far</code>, is the distance from the camera
      to the far

      plane. For example, calling <code>myCamera.perspective(0.5, 1.5, 100,
      10000)</code>

      sets the camera’s field of view to 0.5 radians, its aspect ratio to 1.5,

      places the near plane 100 pixels from the camera, and places the far plane

      10,000 pixels from the camera. Any shapes drawn more than 10,000 pixels

      from the camera won’t be visible. By default, <code>far</code> is set to
      <code>10 * 800</code>,

      which is 10 times the default distance between the camera and the
      origin.</p>
    path: p5.Camera/perspective
  ortho:
    description: >
      <p>Sets an orthographic projection for the camera.</p>

      <p>In an orthographic projection, shapes with the same size always appear
      the

      same size, regardless of whether they are near or far from the camera.</p>

      <p><code>myCamera.ortho()</code> changes the camera’s perspective by
      changing its viewing

      frustum from a truncated pyramid to a rectangular prism. The frustum is
      the

      volume of space that’s visible to the camera. The camera is placed in
      front

      of the frustum and views everything within the frustum.
      <code>myCamera.ortho()</code>

      has six optional parameters to define the viewing frustum.</p>

      <p>The first four parameters, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>,
      <code>bottom</code>, and <code>top</code>, set the

      coordinates of the frustum’s sides, bottom, and top. For example, calling

      <code>myCamera.ortho(-100, 100, 200, -200)</code> creates a frustum that’s
      200 pixels

      wide and 400 pixels tall. By default, these dimensions are set based on

      the sketch’s width and height, as in

      <code>myCamera.ortho(-width / 2, width / 2, -height / 2, height /
      2)</code>.</p>

      <p>The last two parameters, <code>near</code> and <code>far</code>, set
      the distance of the

      frustum’s near and far plane from the camera. For example, calling

      <code>myCamera.ortho(-100, 100, 200, -200, 50, 1000)</code> creates a
      frustum that’s

      200 pixels wide, 400 pixels tall, starts 50 pixels from the camera, and

      ends 1,000 pixels from the camera. By default, <code>near</code> and
      <code>far</code> are set to

      0 and <code>max(width, height) + 800</code>, respectively.</p>
    path: p5.Camera/ortho
  frustum:
    description: >
      <p>Sets the camera's frustum.</p>

      <p>In a frustum projection, shapes that are further from the camera appear

      smaller than shapes that are near the camera. This technique, called

      foreshortening, creates realistic 3D scenes.</p>

      <p><code>myCamera.frustum()</code> changes the camera’s perspective by
      changing its

      viewing frustum. The frustum is the volume of space that’s visible to the

      camera. The frustum’s shape is a pyramid with its top cut off. The camera

      is placed where the top of the pyramid should be and points towards the

      base of the pyramid. It views everything within the frustum.</p>

      <p>The first four parameters, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>,
      <code>bottom</code>, and <code>top</code>, set the

      coordinates of the frustum’s sides, bottom, and top. For example, calling

      <code>myCamera.frustum(-100, 100, 200, -200)</code> creates a frustum
      that’s 200

      pixels wide and 400 pixels tall. By default, these coordinates are set

      based on the sketch’s width and height, as in

      <code>myCamera.frustum(-width / 20, width / 20, height / 20, -height /
      20)</code>.</p>

      <p>The last two parameters, <code>near</code> and <code>far</code>, set
      the distance of the

      frustum’s near and far plane from the camera. For example, calling

      <code>myCamera.frustum(-100, 100, 200, -200, 50, 1000)</code> creates a
      frustum that’s

      200 pixels wide, 400 pixels tall, starts 50 pixels from the camera, and
      ends

      1,000 pixels from the camera. By default, near is set to <code>0.1 *
      800</code>, which

      is 1/10th the default distance between the camera and the origin.
      <code>far</code> is

      set to <code>10 * 800</code>, which is 10 times the default distance
      between the

      camera and the origin.</p>

  roll:
    description: >
      <p>Rotates the camera in a clockwise/counter-clockwise direction.</p>

      <p>Rolling rotates the camera without changing its orientation. The
      rotation

      happens in the camera’s "local" space.</p>

      <p>The parameter, <code>angle</code>, is the angle the camera should
      rotate. Passing a

      positive angle, as in <code>myCamera.roll(0.001)</code>, rotates the
      camera in counter-clockwise direction.

      Passing a negative angle, as in <code>myCamera.roll(-0.001)</code>,
      rotates the

      camera in clockwise direction.</p>

      <p>The parameter, <code>angle</code>, is the angle the camera should

      positive angle, as in <code>myCamera.pan(0.001)</code>, rotates the camera
      to the

      right. Passing a negative angle, as in <code>myCamera.pan(-0.001)</code>,
      rotates the

      camera to the left.</p>

  tilt:
    description: >
      <p>Rotates the camera up and down.</p>

      <p>Tilting rotates the camera without changing its position. The rotation

      happens in the camera’s "local" space.</p>

      <p>The parameter, <code>angle</code>, is the angle the camera should
      rotate. Passing a

      positive angle, as in <code>myCamera.tilt(0.001)</code>, rotates the
      camera down.

      Passing a negative angle, as in <code>myCamera.tilt(-0.001)</code>,
      rotates the camera

      up.</p>

      <p>Note: Angles are interpreted based on the current

      <a href="/reference/p5/angleMode/">angleMode()</a>.</p>
    path: p5.Camera/tilt
  lookAt:
    description: >
      <p>Points the camera at a location.</p>

      <p><code>myCamera.lookAt()</code> changes the camera’s orientation without
      changing its

      position.</p>

      <p>The parameters, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>, are
      the coordinates in "world" space

      where the camera should point. For example, calling

      <code>myCamera.lookAt(10, 20, 30)</code> points the camera at the
      coordinates

      <code>(10, 20, 30)</code>.</p>
    path: p5.Camera/lookAt
  camera:
    description: >
      <p>Sets the position and orientation of the camera.</p>

      <p><code>myCamera.camera()</code> allows objects to be viewed from
      different angles. It

      has nine parameters that are all optional.</p>

      <p>The first three parameters, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and
      <code>z</code>, are the coordinates of the

      camera’s position in "world" space. For example, calling

      <code>myCamera.camera(0, 0, 0)</code> places the camera at the origin
      <code>(0, 0, 0)</code>. By

      default, the camera is placed at <code>(0, 0, 800)</code>.</p>

      <p>The next three parameters, <code>centerX</code>, <code>centerY</code>,
      and <code>centerZ</code> are the

      coordinates of the point where the camera faces in "world" space. For

      example, calling <code>myCamera.camera(0, 0, 0, 10, 20, 30)</code> places
      the camera

      at the origin <code>(0, 0, 0)</code> and points it at <code>(10, 20,
      30)</code>. By default, the

      camera points at the origin <code>(0, 0, 0)</code>.</p>

      <p>The last three parameters, <code>upX</code>, <code>upY</code>, and
      <code>upZ</code> are the components of

      the "up" vector in "local" space. The "up" vector orients the camera’s

      y-axis. For example, calling

      <code>myCamera.camera(0, 0, 0, 10, 20, 30, 0, -1, 0)</code> places the
      camera at the

      origin <code>(0, 0, 0)</code>, points it at <code>(10, 20, 30)</code>, and
      sets the "up" vector

      to <code>(0, -1, 0)</code> which is like holding it upside-down. By
      default, the "up"

      vector is <code>(0, 1, 0)</code>.</p>
    path: p5.Camera/camera
  move:
    description: >
      <p>Moves the camera along its "local" axes without changing its
      orientation.</p>

      <p>The parameters, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>, are
      the distances the camera should

      move. For example, calling <code>myCamera.move(10, 20, 30)</code> moves
      the camera 10

      pixels to the right, 20 pixels down, and 30 pixels backward in its "local"

      space.</p>
    path: p5.Camera/move
  setPosition:
    description: >
      <p>Sets the camera’s position in "world" space without changing its

      orientation.</p>

      <p>The parameters, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>, are
      the coordinates where the camera

      should be placed. For example, calling <code>myCamera.setPosition(10, 20,
      30)</code>

      places the camera at coordinates <code>(10, 20, 30)</code> in "world"
      space.</p>
    path: p5.Camera/setPosition
  set:
    description: >
      <p>Sets the camera’s position, orientation, and projection by copying
      another

      camera.</p>

      <p>The parameter, <code>cam</code>, is the <code>p5.Camera</code> object
      to copy. For example, calling

      <code>cam2.set(cam1)</code> will set <code>cam2</code> using
      <code>cam1</code>’s configuration.</p>
    path: p5.Camera/set
  slerp:
    description: >
      <p>Sets the camera’s position and orientation to values that are
      in-between

      those of two other cameras.</p>

      <p><code>myCamera.slerp()</code> uses spherical linear interpolation to
      calculate a

      position and orientation that’s in-between two other cameras. Doing so is

      helpful for transitioning smoothly between two perspectives.</p>

      <p>The first two parameters, <code>cam0</code> and <code>cam1</code>, are
      the <code>p5.Camera</code> objects

      that should be used to set the current camera.</p>

      <p>The third parameter, <code>amt</code>, is the amount to interpolate
      between <code>cam0</code> and

      <code>cam1</code>. 0.0 keeps the camera’s position and orientation equal
      to <code>cam0</code>’s,

      0.5 sets them halfway between <code>cam0</code>’s and <code>cam1</code>’s
      , and 1.0 sets the

      position and orientation equal to <code>cam1</code>’s.</p>

      <p>For example, calling <code>myCamera.slerp(cam0, cam1, 0.1)</code> sets
      cam’s position

      and orientation very close to <code>cam0</code>’s. Calling

      <code>myCamera.slerp(cam0, cam1, 0.9)</code> sets cam’s position and
      orientation very

      close to <code>cam1</code>’s.</p>
