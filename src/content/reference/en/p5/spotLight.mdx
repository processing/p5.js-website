description: >
  <p>Creates a spot light with the given color, position,

  light direction, angle, and concentration.</p>

  <p>Like a <a href="#/p5/pointLight">pointLight()</a>, a spotLight()

  emits light from a specific point (position). It has a different effect

  when it is positioned farther vs. nearer an object.</p>

  <p>However, unlike a pointLight(), the light is emitted in <strong>one
  direction</strong>

  along a conical shape. The shape of the cone can be controlled using

  the <code>angle</code> and <code>concentration</code> parameters.</p>

  <p>The <code>angle</code> parameter is used to

  determine the radius of the cone. And the <code>concentration</code>

  parameter is used to focus the light towards the center of

  the cone. Both parameters are optional, however if you want

  to specify <code>concentration</code>, you must also specify
  <code>angle</code>.

  The minimum concentration value is 1.</p>

  <p>A maximum of <strong>5</strong> spot lights can be active at once.</p>

  <p>Note: lights need to be called (whether directly or indirectly)

  within draw() to remain persistent in a looping program.

  Placing them in setup() will cause them to only have an effect

  the first time through the loop.</p>
