  <p>This function is used to apply a regular expression to a piece of text,
  and return a list of matching groups (elements found inside parentheses)
  as a two-dimensional String array. If there are no matches, a null value
  will be returned. If no groups are specified in the regular expression,
  but the sequence matches, a two dimensional array is still returned, but
  the second dimension is only of length one.</p>
  <p>To use the function, first check to see if the result is null. If the
  result is null, then the sequence did not match at all. If the sequence
  did match, a 2D array is returned.</p>
  <p>If there are groups (specified by sets of parentheses) in the regular
  expression, then the contents of each will be returned in the array.
  Assuming a loop with counter variable i, element [i][0] of a regular
  expression match returns the entire matching string, and the match groups
  start at element [i][1] (the first group is [i][1], the second [i][2],
  and so on).</p>
