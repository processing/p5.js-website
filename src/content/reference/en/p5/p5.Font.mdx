methods:
  textToPaths:
    description: >
      <p>Returns a flat array of path commands that describe the outlines of a
      string of text.</p>

      <p>Each command is represented as an array of the form <code>[type,
      ...coords]</code>, where:</p>

      <ul><li><code>type</code> is one of <code>'M'</code>, <code>'L'</code>,
      <code>'Q'</code>, <code>'C'</code>, or
      <code>'Z'</code>,</li><li><code>coords</code> are the numeric values
      needed for that command.</li></ul><p><code>'M'</code> indicates a "move
      to" (starting a new contour),

      <code>'L'</code> a line segment,

      <code>'Q'</code> a quadratic bezier,

      <code>'C'</code> a cubic bezier, and

      <code>'Z'</code> closes the current path.</p>

      <p>The first two parameters, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, specify
      the baseline origin for the text.

      Optionally, you can provide a <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>
      for text wrapping; if you don't need

      wrapping, you can omit them and directly pass <code>options</code> as the
      fourth parameter.</p>
    path: p5.Font/textToPaths
  textToPoints:
    description: >
      <p>Returns an array of points outlining a string of text written using the

      font.</p>

      <p>Each point object in the array has three properties that describe the

      point's location and orientation, called its path angle. For example,

      <code>{ x: 10, y: 20, alpha: 450 }</code>.</p>

      <p>The first parameter, <code>str</code>, is a string of text. The second
      and third

      parameters, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, are the text's position. By
      default, they set the

      coordinates of the bounding box's bottom-left corner. See

      <a href="/reference/p5/textAlign/">textAlign()</a> for more ways to align
      text.</p>

      <p>The fourth parameter, <code>options</code>, is also optional.
      <code>font.textToPoints()</code>

      expects an object with the following properties:</p>

      <p><code>sampleFactor</code> is the ratio of the text's path length to the
      number of

      samples. It defaults to 0.1. Higher values produce more points along the

      path and are more precise.</p>

      <p><code>simplifyThreshold</code> removes collinear points if it's set to
      a number other

      than 0. The value represents the threshold angle to use when determining

      whether two edges are collinear.</p>
    path: p5.Font/textToPoints
  textToContours:
    description: >
      <p>Returns an array of arrays of points outlining a string of text written
      using the

      font. Each array represents a contour, so the letter O will have two outer
      arrays:

      one for the outer edge of the shape, and one for the inner edge of the
      hole.</p>

      <p>Each point object in a contour array has three properties that describe
      the

      point's location and orientation, called its path angle. For example,

      <code>{ x: 10, y: 20, alpha: 450 }</code>.</p>

      <p>The first parameter, <code>str</code>, is a string of text. The second
      and third

      parameters, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, are the text's position. By
      default, they set the

      coordinates of the bounding box's bottom-left corner. See

      <a href="/reference/p5/textAlign/">textAlign()</a> for more ways to align
      text.</p>

      <p>The fourth parameter, <code>options</code>, is also optional.
      <code>font.textToPoints()</code>

      expects an object with the following properties:</p>

      <p><code>sampleFactor</code> is the ratio of the text's path length to the
      number of

      samples. It defaults to 0.1. Higher values produce more points along the

      path and are more precise.</p>

      <p><code>simplifyThreshold</code> removes collinear points if it's set to
      a number other

      than 0. The value represents the threshold angle to use when determining

      whether two edges are collinear.</p>

  textToModel:
    description: >
      <p>Converts text into a 3D model that can be rendered in WebGL mode.</p>

      <p>This method transforms flat text into extruded 3D geometry, allowing

      for dynamic effects like depth, warping, and custom shading.</p>

      <p>It works by taking the outlines (contours) of each character in the

      provided text string and constructing a 3D shape from them.</p>

      <p>Once your 3D text is ready, you can rotate it in 3D space using <a
      href="/reference/p5/orbitControl/">orbitControl()</a>

      — just click and drag with your mouse to see it from all angles!</p>

      <p>Use the extrude slider to give your letters depth: slide it up, and
      your

      flat text turns into a solid, multi-dimensional object.</p>

      <p>You can also choose from various fonts such as "Anton", "Montserrat",
      or "Source Serif",

      much like selecting fancy fonts in a word processor,</p>

      <p>The generated model (a Geometry object) can be manipulated
      further—rotated, scaled,

      or styled with shaders—to create engaging, interactive visual art.</p>
