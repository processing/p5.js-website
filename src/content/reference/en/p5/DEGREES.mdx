  <p>Converts an angle measurement in radians to its corresponding value in
  degrees. Degrees and radians are two ways of measuring the same thing.
  There are 360 degrees in a circle and 2 × π (about 6.28)
  radians in a circle. For example, 90° = π ÷ 2 (about 1.57)
  radians. This function doesn't take into account the current
