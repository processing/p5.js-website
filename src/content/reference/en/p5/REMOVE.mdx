  <p>Removes the entire p5 sketch. This will remove the canvas and any
  elements created by p5.js. It will also stop the draw loop and unbind
  any properties or methods from the window global scope. It will
  leave a variable p5 in case you wanted to create a new p5 sketch.
  If you like, you can set p5 = null to erase it. While all functions and
  variables and objects created by the p5 library will be removed, any
  other global variables created by your code will remain.</p>
