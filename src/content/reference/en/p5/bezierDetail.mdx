  <p>Sets the number of segments used to draw Bézier curves in WebGL mode.</p>

  <p>In WebGL mode, smooth shapes are drawn using many flat segments. Adding

  more flat segments makes shapes appear smoother.</p>

  <p>The parameter, <code>detail</code>, is the number of segments to use while
  drawing a

  Bézier curve. For example, calling <code>bezierDetail(5)</code> will use 5
  segments to

  draw curves with the <a href="/reference/p5/bezier/">bezier()</a> function. By

  default,<code>detail</code> is 20.</p>

  <p>Note: <code>bezierDetail()</code> has no effect in 2D mode.</p>
