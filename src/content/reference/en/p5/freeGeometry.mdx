  <p>Clears the resources of a model to free up browser memory. A model whose
  resources have been cleared can still be drawn, but the first time it is
  drawn again, it might take longer.</p>
  <p>This method works on models generated with
  <a href="#/p5/buildGeometry">buildGeometry()</a> as well as those loaded
  from <a href="#/p5/loadModel">loadModel()</a>.</p>
