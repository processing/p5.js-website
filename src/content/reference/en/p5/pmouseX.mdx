  <p>The system variable pmouseX always contains the horizontal position of

  the mouse or finger in the frame previous to the current frame, relative to

  (0, 0) of the canvas. The value at the top-left corner is (0, 0) for 2-D and

  (-width/2, -height/2) for WebGL. Note: pmouseX will be reset to the current
  mouseX

  value at the start of each touch event.</p>
