title: movedX
module: Events
submodule: Mouse
file: src/events/mouse.js
description: >
  <p>A <code>Number</code> system variable that tracks the mouse's horizontal
  movement.</p>

  <p><code>movedX</code> tracks how many pixels the mouse moves left or right
  between

  frames. <code>movedX</code> will have a negative value if the mouse moves left
  between

  frames and a positive value if it moves right. <code>movedX</code> can be
  calculated

  as <code>mouseX - pmouseX</code>.</p>

  <p>Note: <code>movedX</code> continues updating even when

  <a href="/reference/p5/requestPointerLock/">requestPointerLock()</a> is
  active.

  But keep in mind that during an active pointer lock, mouseX and pmouseX

  are locked, so <code>movedX</code> is based on

  <a
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/movementX/">the
  MouseEvent's movementX value</a>

  (which may behave differently in different browsers when the user

  is zoomed in or out).</p>
