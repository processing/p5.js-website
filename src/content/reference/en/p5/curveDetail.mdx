  <p>Sets the number of segments used to draw spline curves in WebGL mode.</p>

  <p>In WebGL mode, smooth shapes are drawn using many flat segments. Adding

  more flat segments makes shapes appear smoother.</p>

  <p>The parameter, <code>detail</code>, is the density of segments to use while
  drawing a

  spline curve.</p>

  <p>Note: <code>curveDetail()</code> has no effect in 2D mode.</p>
