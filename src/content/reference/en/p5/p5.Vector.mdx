description: >
  <p>A class to describe a two or three-dimensional vector.</p>

  <p>A vector can be thought of in different ways. In one view, a vector is like

  an arrow pointing in space. Vectors have both magnitude (length) and

  direction.</p>

  <p><code>p5.Vector</code> objects are often used to program motion because
  they simplify

  the math. For example, a moving ball has a position and a velocity.

  Position describes where the ball is in space. The ball's position vector

  extends from the origin to the ball's center. Velocity describes the ball's

  speed and the direction it's moving. If the ball is moving straight up, its

  velocity vector points straight up. Adding the ball's velocity vector to

  its position vector moves it, as in <code>pos.add(vel)</code>. Vector math
  relies on

  methods inside the <code>p5.Vector</code> class.</p>

  <p>Note: <a href="/reference/p5/createVector/">createVector()</a> is the
  recommended way

  to make an instance of this class.</p>

      // restart from the bottom.
      if (pos.y < 0) {
        pos.y = 100;

methods:
  getValue:
    description: >
      <p>Retrieves the value at the specified index from the vector.</p>

      <p>This method allows you to get the value of a specific component of the
      vector

      by providing its index. Think of the vector as a list of numbers, where
      each

      number represents a different direction (like x, y, or z). The index is
      just

      the position of the number in that list.</p>

      <p>For example, if you have a vector with values 10, 20, 30 the index 0
      would

      give you the first value 10, index 1 would give you the second value 20,

      and so on.</p>
    path: p5.Vector/getValue
  setValue:
    description: >
      <p>Sets the value at the specified index of the vector.</p>

      <p>This method allows you to change a specific component of the vector by
      providing its index and the new value you want to set.

      Think of the vector as a list of numbers, where each number represents a
      different direction (like x, y, or z).

      The index is just the position of the number in that list.</p>

      <p>For example, if you have a vector with values [0, 20, 30], and you want
      to change the second value (20) to 50,

      you would use this method with index 1 (since indexes start at 0) and
      value 50.</p>
    path: p5.Vector/setValue
  toString:
    description: >
      <p>Returns a string representation of a vector.</p>

      <p>Calling <code>toString()</code> is useful for printing vectors to the
      console while

      debugging.</p>
    path: p5.Vector/toString
  set:
    description: >
      <p>Sets the vector's <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>
      components.</p>

      <p><code>set()</code> can use separate numbers, as in <code>v.set(1, 2,
      3)</code>, a

      <a href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> object, as in
      <code>v.set(v2)</code>, or an

      array of numbers, as in <code>v.set([1, 2, 3])</code>.</p>

      <p>If a value isn't provided for a component, it will be set to 0. For

      example, <code>v.set(4, 5)</code> sets <code>v.x</code> to 4,
      <code>v.y</code> to 5, and <code>v.z</code> to 0.

      Calling <code>set()</code> with no arguments, as in <code>v.set()</code>,
      sets all the vector's

      components to 0.</p>

      p5.Vectors created using <a
      href="/reference/p5/createVector/">createVector()</a>

      will take the current <a href="/reference/p5/angleMode/">angleMode</a>
      into

      consideration, and give the angle in radians or degrees accordingly.
    path: p5.Vector/heading
  setHeading:
    description: >
      <p>Rotates a 2D vector to a specific angle without changing its
      magnitude.</p>

      <p>By convention, the positive x-axis has an angle of 0. Angles increase
      in

      the clockwise direction.</p>

      <p>If the vector was created with

      <a href="/reference/p5/createVector/">createVector()</a>,

      between 2D vectors is always a 2D vector.

      Return a representation of this vector as a float array. This is only

      for temporary use. If used in any other fashion, the contents should be

      <p>Replaces the components of a <a
      href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> that are very close to zero
      with zero.</p>

      <p>In computers, handling numbers with decimals can give slightly
      imprecise answers due to the way those numbers are represented.

      This can make it hard to check if a number is zero, as it may be close but
      not exactly zero.

      This method rounds very close numbers to zero to make those checks
      easier</p>
