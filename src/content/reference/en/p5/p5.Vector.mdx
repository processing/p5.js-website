  <p>A class to describe a two or three-dimensional vector.</p>

  <p>A vector can be thought of in different ways. In one view, a vector is like

  an arrow pointing in space. Vectors have both magnitude (length) and

  direction.</p>

  <p><code>p5.Vector</code> objects are often used to program motion because
  they simplify

  the math. For example, a moving ball has a position and a velocity.

  Position describes where the ball is in space. The ball's position vector

  extends from the origin to the ball's center. Velocity describes the ball's

  speed and the direction it's moving. If the ball is moving straight up, its

  velocity vector points straight up. Adding the ball's velocity vector to

  its position vector moves it, as in <code>pos.add(vel)</code>. Vector math
  relies on

  methods inside the <code>p5.Vector</code> class.</p>

  <p>Note: <a href="/reference/p5/createVector">createVector()</a> is the
  recommended way

  to make an instance of this class.</p>

  dot:
    description: >
      <p>Calculates the dot product of two vectors.</p>

      <p>The dot product is a number that describes the overlap between two
      vectors.

      Visually, the dot product can be thought of as the "shadow" one vector

      casts on another. The dot product's magnitude is largest when two vectors

      point in the same or opposite directions. Its magnitude is 0 when two

      vectors form a right angle.</p>

      <p>The version of <code>dot()</code> with one parameter interprets it as
      another

      <a href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> object.</p>

      <p>The version of <code>dot()</code> with multiple parameters interprets
      them as the

      <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> components of another
      vector.</p>

      <p>The static version of <code>dot()</code>, as in <code>p5.Vector.dot(v1,

      by two vectors. The cross product's magnitude is the area of the
      parallelogram

      formed by the original two vectors.</p>

      <p>The static version of <code>cross()</code>, as in

      <p>The static version of <code>dist()</code>, as in

      as calling <code>v1.dist(v2)</code>.</p>

      <p>Use <a href="/reference/p5/dist">dist()</a> to calculate the distance

      <p>The static version of <code>limit()</code>, as in

      new <a href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> object and doesn't

      <p>If the vector was created with

      <code>heading()</code> returns angles

      in the units of the current <a

      <p>The static version of <code>heading()</code>, as in

      <p>If the vector was created with

  angleBetween:

      <p>The angles returned are signed, which means that

      <p>If the vector was created with

      <a href="/reference/p5/createVector">createVector()</a>,
