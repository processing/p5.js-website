  <p>A class to describe a two or three-dimensional vector.</p>

  <p>A vector can be thought of in different ways. In one view, a vector is like

  an arrow pointing in space. Vectors have both magnitude (length) and

  direction.</p>

  <p><code>p5.Vector</code> objects are often used to program motion because
  they simplify

  the math. For example, a moving ball has a position and a velocity.

  Position describes where the ball is in space. The ball's position vector

  extends from the origin to the ball's center. Velocity describes the ball's

  speed and the direction it's moving. If the ball is moving straight up, its

  velocity vector points straight up. Adding the ball's velocity vector to

  its position vector moves it, as in <code>pos.add(vel)</code>. Vector math
  relies on

  methods inside the <code>p5.Vector</code> class.</p>

  <p>Note: <a href="/reference/p5/createVector">createVector()</a> is the
  recommended way

  to make an instance of this class.</p>

  dot:

      <p>Calculates the dot product of two vectors.</p>

      <p>The dot product is a number that describes the overlap between two

      Visually, the dot product can be thought of as the "shadow" one vector

      casts on another. The dot product's magnitude is largest when two vectors

      point in the same or opposite directions. Its magnitude is 0 when two

      vectors form a right angle.</p>

      <p>The version of <code>dot()</code> with one parameter interprets it as

      <a href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> object.</p>
