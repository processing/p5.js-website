  <p>Sets a perspective projection for the current camera in a 3D sketch.</p>

  <p>In a perspective projection, shapes that are further from the camera appear

  smaller than shapes that are near the camera. This technique, called

  foreshortening, creates realistic 3D scenes. It’s applied by default in

  WebGL mode.</p>

  <p><code>perspective()</code> changes the camera’s perspective by changing its
  viewing

  frustum. The frustum is the volume of space that’s visible to the camera.

  Its shape is a pyramid with its top cut off. The camera is placed where

  the top of the pyramid should be and views everything between the frustum’s

  top (near) plane and its bottom (far) plane.</p>

  <p>The first parameter, <code>fovy</code>, is the camera’s vertical field of
  view. It’s

  an angle that describes how tall or narrow a view the camera has. For

  example, calling <code>perspective(0.5)</code> sets the camera’s vertical
  field of

  view to 0.5 radians. By default, <code>fovy</code> is calculated based on the
  sketch’s

  height and the camera’s default z-coordinate, which is 800. The formula for

  the default <code>fovy</code> is <code>2 * atan(height / 2 / 800)</code>.</p>

  <p>The second parameter, <code>aspect</code>, is the camera’s aspect ratio.
  It’s a number

  that describes the ratio of the top plane’s width to its height. For

  example, calling <code>perspective(0.5, 1.5)</code> sets the camera’s field of
  view to

  0.5 radians and aspect ratio to 1.5, which would make shapes appear thinner

  on a square canvas. By default, aspect is set to <code>width /
  height</code>.</p>

  <p>The third parameter, <code>near</code>, is the distance from the camera to
  the near

  plane. For example, calling <code>perspective(0.5, 1.5, 100)</code> sets the
  camera’s

  field of view to 0.5 radians, its aspect ratio to 1.5, and places the near

  plane 100 pixels from the camera. Any shapes drawn less than 100 pixels

  from the camera won’t be visible. By default, near is set to <code>0.1 *
  800</code>,

  which is 1/10th the default distance between the camera and the origin.</p>

  <p>The fourth parameter, <code>far</code>, is the distance from the camera to
  the far

  plane. For example, calling <code>perspective(0.5, 1.5, 100, 10000)</code>
  sets the

  camera’s field of view to 0.5 radians, its aspect ratio to 1.5, places the

  near plane 100 pixels from the camera, and places the far plane 10,000

  pixels from the camera. Any shapes drawn more than 10,000 pixels from the

  camera won’t be visible. By default, far is set to <code>10 * 800</code>,
  which is 10

  times the default distance between the camera and the origin.</p>

  <p>Note: <code>perspective()</code> can only be used in WebGL mode.</p>
