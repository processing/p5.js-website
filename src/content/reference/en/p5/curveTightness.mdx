  <p>Spline curves are like cables that are attached to a set of points.

  <code>curveTightness()</code> adjusts how tightly the cable is attached to the
  points.</p>

  <p>The parameter, <code>tightness</code>, determines how the curve fits to the
  vertex

  points. By default, <code>tightness</code> is set to 0. Setting tightness to
  1,

  as in <code>curveTightness(1)</code>, connects the curve's points using
  straight

  lines. Values in the range from â€“5 to  5 deform curves while leaving them

  recognizable.</p>
