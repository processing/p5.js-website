  <p>Reads the contents of a file and creates a String array of its individual
  lines. If the name of the file is used as the parameter, as in the above
  example, the file must be located in the sketch directory/folder.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, the file may be loaded from anywhere on the local
  computer using an absolute path (something that starts with / on Unix and
  Linux, or a drive letter on Windows), or the filename parameter can be a
  URL for a file found on a network.</p>
  <p>This method is asynchronous, meaning it may not finish before the next
  line in your sketch is executed.</p>
  <p>This method is suitable for fetching files up to size of 64MB.</p>

    Calling loadStrings() inside <a href="#/p5/preload">preload()</a> guarantees
    to complete the

    operation before <a href="#/p5/setup">setup()</a> and <a
    href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> are called.


    <div><code>

    let result;

    function preload() {
      result = loadStrings('/assets/test.txt');
    }


    function setup() {
      background(200);
      text(random(result), 10, 10, 80, 80);
      describe(`randomly generated text from a file,
        for example "i smell like butter"`);
    }

    </code></div>


    Outside of preload(), you may supply a callback function to handle the

    object:


    <div><code>

    function setup() {
      loadStrings('/assets/test.txt', pickString);
      describe(`randomly generated text from a file,
        for example "i have three feet"`);
    }


    function pickString(result) {
      background(200);
      text(random(result), 10, 10, 80, 80);
    }

    </code></div>
