  <p>A way to repeat a block of code.</p>

  <p><code>while</code> loops are helpful for repeating statements while a
  condition is

  <code>true</code>. They're like <code>if</code> statements that repeat. For
  example, a <code>while</code>

  loop makes it easy to express the idea "draw several lines" like so:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-js">// Declare a variable to keep track of
  iteration.

  let x = 10;


  // Repeat as long as x < 100

  while (x < 100) {
    line(x, 25, x, 75);

    // Increment by 20.
    x += 20;
  }

  </code></pre>

  <p>The loop's header begins with the keyword <code>while</code>. Loops
  generally count up

  or count down as they repeat, or iterate. The statement in parentheses

  <code>x < 100</code> is a condition the loop checks each time it iterates. If
  the

  condition is <code>true</code>, the loop runs the code between the curly
  braces <code>{}</code>,

  The code between the curly braces is called the loop's body. If the

  condition is <code>false</code>, the body is skipped and the loop is
  stopped.</p>

  <p>It's common to create infinite loops accidentally. For example, the

  following loop never stops iterating because it doesn't count up:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-js">// Declare a variable to keep track of
  iteration.

  let x = 10;


  // Repeat as long as x < 100

  while (x < 100) {
    line(x, 25, x, 75);
  }


  // This should be in the loop's body!

  x += 20;

  </code></pre>

  <p>The statement <code>x += 20</code> appears after the loop's body. That
  means the

  variable <code>x</code> is stuck at <code>10</code>,  which is always less
  than <code>100</code>.</p>

  <p><code>while</code> loops are useful when the number of iterations isn't
  known in

  advance. For example, concentric circles could be drawn at random

  increments:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-js">let d = 100;

  let minSize = 5;


  while (d > minSize) {
    circle(50, 50, d);
    d -= random(10);
  }

  </code></pre>

    function setup() {
      createCanvas(100, 100);

      // Slow the frame rate.
      frameRate(5);

      describe(
        "A gray square with several concentric circles at the center. The circles' sizes decrease at random increments."
      );

      background(200);

        d -= random(5, 15);
