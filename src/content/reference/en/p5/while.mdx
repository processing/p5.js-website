  <p><a href="#/p5/while">while</a> creates a loop that is useful for executing

  one section of code multiple times.</p>

  <p>With a 'while loop', the code inside of the loop body (between the curly

  braces) is run repeatedly until the test condition (inside of the parenthesis)

  evaluates to false. The condition is tested before executing the code body

  with <a href="#/p5/while">while</a>, so if the condition is initially false

  the loop body, or statement, will never execute.</p>

  <p>As with any loop, it is important to ensure that the loop can 'exit', or
  that

  the test condition will eventually evaluate to false. This is to keep your
  loop

  from trying to run an infinite amount of times, which can crash your
  browser.</p>

  <p>From <a
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while">the
  MDN entry</a>:

  The while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long

  as the test condition evaluates to true.The condition is evaluated before

  executing the statement.</p>
