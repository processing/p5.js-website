  <p>Creates a new <a href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> object.</p>

  <p>A vector can be thought of in different ways. In one view, a vector is like

  an arrow pointing in space. Vectors have both magnitude (length) and

  direction. This view is helpful for programming motion.</p>

  <p>A vector's components determine its magnitude and direction. For example,

  calling <code>createVector(3, 4)</code> creates a new

  <a href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> object with an x-component of
  3 and a

  y-component of 4. From the origin, this vector's tip is 3 units to the

  right and 4 units down.</p>

  <p><a href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> objects are often used to
  program

  motion because they simplify the math. For example, a moving ball has a

  position and a velocity. Position describes where the ball is in space. The

  ball's position vector extends from the origin to the ball's center.

  Velocity describes the ball's speed and the direction it's moving. If the

  ball is moving straight up, its velocity vector points straight up. Adding

  the ball's velocity vector to its position vector moves it, as in

  <code>pos.add(vel)</code>. Vector math relies on methods inside the

  <a href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> class.</p>
