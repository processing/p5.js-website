description: >
  <p>A class to describe a print stream.</p>

  <p>Each <code>p5.PrintWriter</code> object provides a way to save a sequence
  of text

  data, called the <em>print stream</em>, to the user's computer. It's a
  low-level

  object that enables precise control of text output. Functions such as

  <a href="/reference/p5/saveStrings/">saveStrings()</a> and

  <a href="/reference/p5/saveJSON/">saveJSON()</a> are easier to use for simple
  file

  saving.</p>

  <p>Note: <a href="/reference/p5/createWriter/">createWriter()</a> is the
  recommended way

  to make an instance of this class.</p>
