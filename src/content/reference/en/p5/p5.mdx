  <p>This is the p5 instance constructor.</p>

  <p>A p5 instance holds all the properties and methods related to

  a p5 sketch.  It expects an incoming sketch closure and it can also

  take an optional node parameter for attaching the generated p5 canvas

  to a node.  The sketch closure takes the newly created p5 instance as

  its sole argument and may optionally set <a
  href="/reference/p5/preload/">preload()</a>,

  <a href="/reference/p5/setup/">setup()</a>, and/or

  <a href="/reference/p5/draw/">draw()</a> properties on it for running a
  sketch.</p>

  <p>A p5 sketch can run in "global" or "instance" mode:

  "global"   - all properties and methods are attached to the window

  "instance" - all properties and methods are bound to this p5 object</p>
