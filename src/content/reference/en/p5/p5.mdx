  <p>This is the p5 instance constructor.</p>
  <p>A p5 instance holds all the properties and methods related to
  a p5 sketch.  It expects an incoming sketch closure and it can also
  take an optional node parameter for attaching the generated p5 canvas
  to a node.  The sketch closure takes the newly created p5 instance as
  its sole argument and may optionally set <a href="#/p5/preload">preload()</a>,
  <a href="#/p5/setup">setup()</a>, and/or
  <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> properties on it for running a sketch.</p>
  <p>A p5 sketch can run in "global" or "instance" mode:
  "global"   - all properties and methods are attached to the window
  "instance" - all properties and methods are bound to this p5 object</p>
