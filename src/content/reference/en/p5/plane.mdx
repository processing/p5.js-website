  <p>Draws a plane.</p>

  <p>A plane is a four-sided, flat shape with every angle measuring 90˚. It’s

  similar to a rectangle and offers advanced drawing features in WebGL mode.</p>

  <p>The first parameter, <code>width</code>, is optional. If a
  <code>Number</code> is passed, as in

  <code>plane(20)</code>, it sets the plane’s width and height. By default,
  <code>width</code> is

  50.</p>

  <p>The second parameter, <code>height</code>, is also optional. If a
  <code>Number</code> is passed,

  as in <code>plane(20, 30)</code>, it sets the plane’s height. By default,
  <code>height</code> is

  set to the plane’s <code>width</code>.</p>

  <p>The third parameter, <code>detailX</code>, is also optional. If a
  <code>Number</code> is passed,

  as in <code>plane(20, 30, 5)</code> it sets the number of triangle
  subdivisions to use

  along the x-axis. All 3D shapes are made by connecting triangles to form

  their surfaces. By default, <code>detailX</code> is 1.</p>

  <p>The fourth parameter, <code>detailY</code>, is also optional. If a
  <code>Number</code> is passed,

  as in <code>plane(20, 30, 5, 7)</code> it sets the number of triangle
  subdivisions to

  use along the y-axis. All 3D shapes are made by connecting triangles to

  form their surfaces. By default, <code>detailY</code> is 1.</p>

  <p>Note: <code>plane()</code> can only be used in WebGL mode.</p>
