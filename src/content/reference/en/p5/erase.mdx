description: >
  <p>Starts using shapes to erase parts of the canvas.</p>

  <p>All drawing that follows <code>erase()</code> will subtract from the
  canvas, revealing

  the web page underneath. The erased areas will become transparent, allowing

  the content behind the canvas to show through. The

  <a href="/reference/p5/fill/">fill()</a>, <a
  href="/reference/p5/stroke/">stroke()</a>, and

  <a href="/reference/p5/blendMode/">blendMode()</a> have no effect once
  <code>erase()</code> is

  called.</p>

  <p>The <code>erase()</code> function has two optional parameters. The first
  parameter

  sets the strength of erasing by the shape's interior. A value of 0 means

  that no erasing will occur. A value of 255 means that the shape's interior

  will fully erase the content underneath. The default value is 255

  (full strength).</p>

  <p>The second parameter sets the strength of erasing by the shape's edge. A

  value of 0 means that no erasing will occur. A value of 255 means that the

  shape's edge will fully erase the content underneath. The default value is

  255 (full strength).</p>

  <p>To cancel the erasing effect, use the <a
  href="/reference/p5/noErase/">noErase()</a>

  function.</p>

  <p><code>erase()</code> has no effect on drawing done with the

  <a href="/reference/p5/image/">image()</a> and

  <a href="/reference/p5/background/">background()</a> functions.</p>
