  <p>Calculates coordinates along a line that's tangent to a spline curve.</p>

  <p>Tangent lines skim the surface of a curve. A tangent line's slope equals

  the curve's slope at the point where it intersects.</p>

  <p><code>curveTangent()</code> calculates coordinates along a tangent line
  using the

  spline curve's anchor and control points. It expects points in the same

  order as the <a href="/reference/p5/curve/">curve()</a> function.
  <code>curveTangent()</code>

  works one axis at a time. Passing the anchor and control points'

  x-coordinates will calculate the x-coordinate of a point on the tangent

  line. Passing the anchor and control points' y-coordinates will calculate

  the y-coordinate of a point on the tangent line.</p>

  <p>The first parameter, <code>a</code>, is the coordinate of the first control
  point.</p>

  <p>The second and third parameters, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>, are the
  coordinates of the

  anchor points.</p>

  <p>The fourth parameter, <code>d</code>, is the coordinate of the last control
  point.</p>

  <p>The fifth parameter, <code>t</code>, is the amount to interpolate along the
  curve. 0

  is the first anchor point, 1 is the second anchor point, and 0.5 is halfway

  between them.</p>
