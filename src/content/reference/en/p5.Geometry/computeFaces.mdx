  <p>Computes the geometry's faces using its vertices.</p>

  <p>All 3D shapes are made by connecting sets of points called
  <em>vertices</em>. A

  geometry's surface is formed by connecting vertices to form triangles that

  are stitched together. Each triangular patch on the geometry's surface is

  called a <em>face</em>. <code>myGeometry.computeFaces()</code> performs the
  math needed to

  define each face based on the distances between vertices.</p>

  <p>The geometry's vertices are stored as <a
  href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a>

  objects in the <a
  href="/reference/p5.Geometry/vertices/">myGeometry.vertices</a>

  array. The geometry's first vertex is the

  <a href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> object at
  <code>myGeometry.vertices[0]</code>,

  its second vertex is <code>myGeometry.vertices[1]</code>, its third vertex is

  <code>myGeometry.vertices[2]</code>, and so on.</p>

  <p>Calling <code>myGeometry.computeFaces()</code> fills the

  <a href="/reference/p5.Geometry/faces/">myGeometry.faces</a> array with
  three-element

  arrays that list the vertices that form each face. For example, a geometry

  made from a rectangle has two faces because a rectangle is made by joining

  two triangles. <a href="/reference/p5.Geometry/faces/">myGeometry.faces</a>
  for a

  rectangle would be the two-dimensional array

  <code>[[0, 1, 2], [2, 1, 3]]</code>. The first face,
  <code>myGeometry.faces[0]</code>, is the

  array <code>[0, 1, 2]</code> because it's formed by connecting

  <code>myGeometry.vertices[0]</code>, <code>myGeometry.vertices[1]</code>,and

  <code>myGeometry.vertices[2]</code>. The second face,
  <code>myGeometry.faces[1]</code>, is the

  array <code>[2, 1, 3]</code> because it's formed by connecting

  <code>myGeometry.vertices[2]</code>, <code>myGeometry.vertices[1]</code>, and

  <code>myGeometry.vertices[3]</code>.</p>

  <p>Note: <code>myGeometry.computeFaces()</code> only works when geometries
  have four or more vertices.</p>
