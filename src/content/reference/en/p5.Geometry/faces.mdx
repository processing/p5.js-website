  <p>An array that lists which of the geometry's vertices form each of its

  faces.</p>

  <p>All 3D shapes are made by connecting sets of points called
  <em>vertices</em>. A

  geometry's surface is formed by connecting vertices to form triangles

  that are stitched together. Each triangular patch on the geometry's

  surface is called a <em>face</em>.</p>

  <p>The geometry's vertices are stored as

  <a href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> objects in the

  <a href="/reference/p5.Geometry/vertices/">myGeometry.vertices</a> array. The

  geometry's first vertex is the <a href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a>

  object at <code>myGeometry.vertices[0]</code>, its second vertex is

  <code>myGeometry.vertices[1]</code>, its third vertex is
  <code>myGeometry.vertices[2]</code>,

  and so on.</p>

  <p>For example, a geometry made from a rectangle has two faces because a

  rectangle is made by joining two triangles. <code>myGeometry.faces</code> for
  a

  rectangle would be the two-dimensional array <code>[[0, 1, 2], [2, 1,
  3]]</code>.

  The first face, <code>myGeometry.faces[0]</code>, is the array <code>[0, 1,
  2]</code> because

  it's formed by connecting <code>myGeometry.vertices[0]</code>,

  <code>myGeometry.vertices[1]</code>,and <code>myGeometry.vertices[2]</code>.
  The second face,

  <code>myGeometry.faces[1]</code>, is the array <code>[2, 1, 3]</code> because
  it's formed by

  connecting <code>myGeometry.vertices[2]</code>,
  <code>myGeometry.vertices[1]</code>,and

  <code>myGeometry.vertices[3]</code>.</p>
