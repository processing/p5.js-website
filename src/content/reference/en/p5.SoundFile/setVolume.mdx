description: |
  <p>Multiply the output volume (amplitude) of a sound file
  between 0.0 (silence) and 1.0 (full volume).
  1.0 is the maximum amplitude of a digital sound, so multiplying
  by greater than 1.0 may cause digital distortion. To
  fade, provide a <code>rampTime</code> parameter. For more
  complex fades, see the Envelope class.</p>
  <p>Alternately, you can pass in a signal source such as an
  oscillator to modulate the amplitude with an audio signal.</p>
