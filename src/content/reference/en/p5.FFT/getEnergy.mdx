  <p>Returns the amount of energy (volume) at a specific
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_frequency/" target="_blank">
  frequency</a>, or the average amount of energy between two
  frequencies. Accepts Number(s) corresponding
  to frequency (in Hz), or a "string" corresponding to predefined
  frequency ranges ("bass", "lowMid", "mid", "highMid", "treble").
  Returns a range between 0 (no energy/volume at that frequency) and
  255 (maximum energy).
  <em>NOTE: analyze() must be called prior to getEnergy(). analyze()
  tells the FFT to analyze frequency data, and getEnergy() uses
  the results to determine the value at a specific frequency or
  range of frequencies.</em></p>
