  <p>Returns an array of average amplitude values for a given number
  of frequency bands split equally. N defaults to 16.
  <em>NOTE: analyze() must be called prior to linAverages(). Analyze()
  tells the FFT to analyze frequency data, and linAverages() uses
  the results to group them into a smaller set of averages.</em></p>
