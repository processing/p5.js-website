    description: |
      <p>Ratio between attackLevel and releaseLevel, on a scale from 0 to 1,
                                    where 1.0 = attackLevel, 0.0 = releaseLevel.
                                    The susRatio determines the decayLevel and the level at which the
                                    sustain portion of the envelope will sustain.
                                    For example, if attackLevel is 0.4, releaseLevel is 0,
                                    and susAmt is 0.5, the decayLevel would be 0.2. If attackLevel is
                                    increased to 1.0 (using <code>setRange</code>),
                                    then decayLevel would increase proportionally, to become 0.5.</p>
