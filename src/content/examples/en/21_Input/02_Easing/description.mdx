Move the mouse across the screen and the symbol
will follow. Between drawing each frame of the animation, the
program calculates the difference between the position of the
symbol and the cursor. If the distance is larger than 1 pixel,
the symbol moves part of the distance (0.05) from its current
position toward the cursor.
