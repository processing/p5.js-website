Demonstration of flocking behavior.
Full discussion of the implementation can be found in the
<a href="https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/">Nature of Code</a>
book by Daniel Shiffman. The simulation is based on the research of
<a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/">Craig Reynolds</a>, who
used the term 'boid' to represent a bird-like object.
