This example uses two custom
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/class" target="_blank">classes</a>.
The Particle class stores a position, velocity, and hue. It renders
a circle using the current position and hue, and it updates the
position using the current velocity. The Path class stores an array
of objects created from the Particle class. It renders lines
connecting each of the particles. When the user clicks the mouse, the
sketch creates a new instance of the Path class. When the user drags
the mouse, the sketch adds a new instance of the Particle class to
the current path.
