This example demonstrates the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_and_cosine">sine and cosine</a>
mathematical functions.

The animation shows uniform circular motion around the unit circle
(circle with radius 1). Any angle measured from the the x-axis
determines a point on the circle. The cosine and sine of the angle
are defined to be the x and y coordinates, respectively, of that
point.
