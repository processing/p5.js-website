This example demonstrates how to create a shape
by specifying its vertices in TRIANGLE_STRIP mode, using the
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/beginShape">beginShape()</a>,
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/endShape">endShape()</a>,
and
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/vertex">vertex()</a>
functions.
