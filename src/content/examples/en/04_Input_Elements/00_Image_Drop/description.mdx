<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Element/drop" target="_blank">drop()</a>
is a p5.js element method that registers a callback every time a file is loaded 
into the element. The uploaded file is created into a 
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.File" target="_blank">p5.File</a> 
class. You can use the 
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Element/drop" target="_blank">drop()</a> 
callback to check the file type, then write conditional statements responding to 
the file type.
