This expands on the Shape Primitives example by adding
color.
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/background" target="_blank">background()</a>
fills the canvas with one color,
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/stroke" target="_blank">stroke()</a>
sets the color for drawing lines, and
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/fill" target="_blank">fill()</a>
sets the color for the inside of shapes.
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/noFill" target="_blank">noStroke()</a> and
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/noFill" target="_blank">noFill()</a>
turn off line color and inner color, respectively.

Colors can be represented in many different ways. This example demonstrates several options.
