This example demonstrates a game with a time limit and score. The browser's
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage" target="_blank">local storage</a>
stores the high score so when the game is played again using the same browser,
the high score remains. Clearing the browser data also clears the high score.
