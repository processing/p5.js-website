In 3D rendering, a material determines how a surface
responds to light. p5's

mode supports
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ambientMaterial" target="_blank">ambient</a>,
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/emissiveMaterial" target="_blank">emissive</a>,

<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/specularMaterial" target="_blank">specular</a>
materials.

An ambient material responds to ambient light only. A specular
material responds to any light source. In p5, an emissive material
displays its color regardless of light source. In other contexts,
typically an emissive material emits light. A normal material
visualizes the direction each part of the surface faces. A normal
material does not respond to light.

Ambient and emissive materials can be combined with each other.
They can also be combined with fill and stroke. Fill sets a base
color for the surface, and stroke sets the color for the object's
vertices.

Additionally,

wraps an object with an image. The model and image texture in this example are
