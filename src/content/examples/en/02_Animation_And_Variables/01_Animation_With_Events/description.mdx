This example demonstrates the use of
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/loop">loop()</a>
and
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/noLoop">noLoop()</a>
to pause and resume the animation.

Clicking the mouse toggles the animation loop. If the animation
loop is stopped, the user can press any key to advance one frame.
Note: the user must click to set the focus on the canvas for
key presses to be registered.

Advancing a single frame is accomplished by calling the
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/redraw">redraw()</a>
function, which results in a single call to the draw() function.
