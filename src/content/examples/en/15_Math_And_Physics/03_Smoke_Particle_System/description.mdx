This smoke particle system demo makes use of the
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a>
class, including the
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/createVector">createVector()</a>
function. The various calculations for updating particles'
positions and velocities are performed with p5.Vector methods.

The particle system is implemented as a
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/class">class</a>, which contains an array of
objects (of class Particle).
