Smoke particle system demo, based on
Dan Shiffman's original
<a href="https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-4-particle-systems/">example</a>
for Processing.

The code makes use of the
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a>
class, including the
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createVector">createVector()</a>
function. The various calculations for updating particles'
positions and velocities are performed with p5.Vector methods.

The particle system is implemented as a
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/class">class</a>, which contains an array of
objects (of class Particle).
