The
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/rotate">rotate()</a>
function rotates the current coordinate system around the current
origin.

Note that by default the origin is the upper left corner of the canvas.
In order to rotate around the center of the canvas, we must first
translate the coordinate system, and then rotate around the new origin.

The 
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/push">push()</a>
and
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/pop">pop()</a>
functions save and restore the coordinate system, respectively.
