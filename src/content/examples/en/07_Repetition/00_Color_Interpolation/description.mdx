calculates a value between two other values. For example, the number 5 is
halfway between 0 and 10. Different types of interpolation use
different rates of change between values. Linear interpolation,
abbreviated as lerp, uses a constant rate of change. The
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/lerp" target="_blank">lerp()</a>
function linearly interpolates between two numbers. The
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/lerpColor" target="_blank">lerpColor()</a>
function, demonstrated here, linearly interpolates between two colors.
In this example, the stripeCount variable adjusts how many horizontal
stripes appear. Setting the value to a higher number will look less
like individual stripes and more like a gradient.
