<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise" target="_blank">Perlin noise</a>
is an algorithm written by Ken Perlin to produce sequences that appear both
random and organic. The
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/noise" target="_blank">noise()</a>
function in p5 produces Perlin noise.

The dots in this example are sized based on noise values. The slider on the
left sets the distance between dots. The slider on the right sets an offset
in the noise calculation.
