This example illustrates the appearance of different
hues. It uses a
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/for" target="_blank">for loop</a>
to repeat transformations. The loop initializes
a variable called angle, which changes the rotation of a circle as
well as its hue. Each time the loop repeats, a circle is drawn
relative to the center of the canvas. The
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/push" target="_blank">push()</a>
and <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/pop" target="_blank">pop()</a>
functions make these transformations affect only the individual circle.
