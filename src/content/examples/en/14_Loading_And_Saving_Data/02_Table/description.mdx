Comma-Separated Values, or CSV, is a format for writing
data in a file. p5 can work with this format using a
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/p5.Table" target="_blank">p5.Table</a>.
This example is based on Daniel Shiffman's
<a href="https://processing.org/examples/loadsavetable.html" target="_blank">Loading Tabular Data</a>
example for Processing. It uses a class to organize data representing
a bubble. When the sketch starts, it loads the data for four bubbles
from a CSV file. The visitor can add new bubbles, download an updated
CSV file, and load in a CSV file.
