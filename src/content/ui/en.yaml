  PageDescription: p5.js was created by Lauren Lee McCarthy in 2013 as a new interpretation of Processing for the context of the web. Since then we have allowed ourselves space to deviate and grow, while drawing inspiration from Processing and our shared community. p5.js is sustained by a community of contributors, with support from the Processing Foundation. p5.js follows a rotating leadership model started in 2020, and Qianqian Ye has been leading p5.js since 2021.
