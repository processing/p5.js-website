Modern computers come with a special piece of hardware called the Graphics Processing Unit, or GPU. Shaders are special programs that run on it and can do incredible things. They take advantage of the GPU to process many pixels at once in parallel, making them fast and particularly well suited for certain tasks in computer graphics, like generating noise, applying filters like blur, or shading polygons.

Shader programming can feel daunting at first, requiring a different approach than the 2D drawing of p5.js. This tutorial will outline the basics of shader programming and point you towards other resources.


## Setup

The way to program the GPU in your browser is by using an API called [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API). p5.js is a great tool for working with shaders because it handles a lot of the boilerplate WebGL setup, letting you focus on the shader code itself. Before we can get started with shaders we have to set up our p5.js canvas so that it uses WebGL mode. We do this by adding the `WEBGL` constant as the third parameter in `createCanvas()`.

```javascript
...

function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200, WEBGL);
}

...
```

A shader program consists of two parts, a **vertex shader** and a **fragment shader**. The vertex shader is a program that runs once for each vertex in a piece of geometry and determines where it gets drawn on the screen. The fragment shader is a program that runs once for every pixel in that geometry and determines its color.

Each of these live in separate files and are loaded into p5.js using the `loadShader()` function. Once a shader is loaded, it can be used within `setup()` or `draw()`. The following example will show how to set up a basic shader within p5.js:

```javascript
let myShader;
function preload() {
  // load each shader file (don't worry, we will come back to these!)
  myShader = loadShader('shader.vert', 'shader.frag');
}
function setup() {
  // the canvas has to be created with WEBGL mode
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight, WEBGL);
}
function draw() {
  // shader() sets the active shader, which will be applied to what is drawn next
  shader(myShader);
  // apply the shader to a rectangle taking up the full canvas
  plane(width, height);
}
```

There is also an additional function called `createShader()`, which can be used to load shaders directly from strings defined in your sketch. 


## Writing Shaders

Now, we'll look at what goes into the vertex and fragment shader files we referenced in `loadShader()`.


### Shading Language (GLSL)

Shader files are written in the Graphics Library Shading Language, or GLSL (based on OpenGL 2.0 and GLSL ES 1.00), and have a very different syntax and structure than we are familiar with. GLSL has a syntax that resembles C, which means it comes with a handful of concepts that aren't present in JavaScript.

For one, the shading language is much more strict about types. Each variable you create has to be labeled with the kind of data it is storing. Here is a list of some of the common types:

```glsl
vec2(x,y)     // a vector of two floats
vec3(x,y,z)   // a vector of three floats (could also be r,g,b)
vec4(x,y,z,w) // a vector of four floats (could also be r,g,b,a)
float         // a number with decimal points
int           // a whole number without decimal points
sampler2D     // a reference to a texture
mat2          // a 2x2 matrix
mat3          // a 3x3 matrix
mat4          // a 4x4 matrix
bool          // true or false
```

In general shading languages are much more strict than JavaScript. A missing semicolon is not allowed and will result in an error message. You can't use different types of numbers, like floats or integers interchangeably. It also will complain about `float`s that aren't defined with a decimal place in them, so you will find yourself writing numbers like `0.0` or `1.0` often.

Here are some things that are different in GLSL:

<table class="full-width">

All variables need types.

</td>

```javascript
let a = 1;
let b = 0.5;
```

</td>

<td>

```glsl
int a = 1;
float b = 0.5;
```

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

Functions must declare the types of their parameters, and their return value.

</td>

```javascript
function isBetween(val, start, end) {
  return val >= start && val <= end;
}
```

</td>

```glsl
bool isBetween(float val, float start, float end) {
  return val >= start && val <= end;

```

</td>

You have to convert between integers and floats yourself.

int a = 1;
float b = 0.5;
float c = b + 2.0;
float d = float(a) + b;
```

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>

Loops in GLSL have to stop at a constant value. If you want to end conditionally, you can `break` out of the loop.

</td>

<td>

```javascript
let maxVal = 10;
if (something) {
  maxVal = 20;
}

</td>

```glsl
int maxVal = 10;
if (something) {

}
for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  if (i == maxVal) {
    break;
  }
  // do something
}
```

</td>

</tr>

</table>

While there are many restrictions, in some ways, GLSL can be nicer to work with! When using vectors, GLSL includes a number of helpful shortcuts:

<table class="full-width">

<tr>

<td>

If you have a `vec4`, you can refer to its data like it is a color or a coordinate. Both are equivalent, so you can use whichever makes your code easier to read.

</td>

<td>

```glsl
//Each pair is equivalent:
myVec.x
myVec.r
myVec.y
myVec.g
myVec.z
myVec.b
myVec.w
myVec.a
```

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>

If you want to create a vector where all of its values are the same, you don't need to specify the same value repeatedly, just once will do.

</td>

<td>

```glsl
// These are equivalent
myVec = vec3(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);
myVec = vec3(0.5);
```

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>

You can get smaller vectors out of a larger vector by using something called "swizzling," where you chain multiple property values together after a `.` in the order you want them in the new vector.

</td>

<td>

```glsl
vec4 bigVec = vec4(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0);
// Equivalent to vec2(bigVec.z, bigVec.y)
vec2 smallVec = bigVec.zy;
```

</td>

</tr>

</table>


### Vertex Shaders

Here's a simple vertex shader that applies the transformations and camera perspective supplied by p5.js:

<AnnotatedCode lang="glsl" code={({ begin, end }) =>
`${begin('precision')}
precision highp float;
${end('precision')}
${begin('attributes')}
attribute vec3 aPosition;
${end('attributes')}
${begin('uniforms')}
// The transform of the object being drawn
uniform mat4 uModelViewMatrix;
// Transforms 3D coordinates to
// 2D screen coordinates
uniform mat4 uProjectionMatrix;
${end('uniforms')}
${begin('main')}
void main() {
  // Apply the camera transform
  vec4 viewModelPosition =
    uModelViewMatrix * vec4(aPosition, 1.0);
  // Tell WebGL where the vertex goes
  gl_Position =
    uProjectionMatrix * viewModelPosition;  
}
${end('main')}`}>
  <Fragment slot="precision">
   The shader starts with a `precision` line. It can either be `lowp`, `mediump`, or `highp`. Using the highest quality is a good place to start to ensure your shaders look the same everywhere. On desktops and laptops, your GPU will likely use the highest quality regardless of what you write. On phones, using a lower quality might be faster, but it may make your shaders render differently.
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="attributes">
    The *attributes* of the shader contain values that change per vertex, which p5.js uses to share information like the position of each vertex. The attribute in this shader is a `vec3`, meaning it contains a value for x, y, and z. Attributes are special variable types that are only used in the vertex shader and are typically provided by p5.js. When you use p5.js methods like `rect()` or `vertex()`, p5.js passes the vertex information to the shader for you automatically.
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="uniforms">
    The *uniforms* of a shader are values that are constants for the whole shape being drawn. Each one in this shader happens to be a `mat4`, which is a type often used to represent transformations like translations, scales, and rotations. Multiplying a point by a `mat4` applies the transformation it represents to the point. The ones in this shader get provided automatically by p5.js, but we'll see later how you can provide your own custom uniforms. Note that the order of multiplication with matrices matters. In most cases you will write the matrix first and the value being multiplied by it second.
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="main">
    All vertex shaders require a function, `main()`, within which we position our vertices by assigning a value to `gl_Position`. This value is in *clip space*, where x, y, and z values go from -1 to 1 as they go from one side to the other. Multiplying a 3D point by `uProjectionMatrix` does this conversion for us using p5.js's camera settings. Before we do that, this shader also multiplies by `uModelViewMatrix` to apply the accumulated transformations that were set before drawing the shape.
  </Fragment>
</AnnotatedCode>

Don't worry if this doesn't make a ton of sense yet. The vertex shader plays an important role but it is often just responsible for making sure what we create in our fragment shader displays properly on the geometry. You'll probably reuse the same vertex shaders in many of your projects. Below is a standard vertex shader you can use that also handles information like per-vertex colors and texture coordinates.

```glsl
precision highp float;
attribute vec3 aPosition;
attribute vec2 aTexCoord;
attribute vec4 aVertexColor;
uniform mat4 uModelViewMatrix;
uniform mat4 uProjectionMatrix;
varying vec2 vTexCoord;
varying vec4 vVertexColor;
void main() {
  // Apply the camera transform
  vec4 viewModelPosition = uModelViewMatrix * vec4(aPosition, 1.0);
  // Tell WebGL where the vertex goes
  gl_Position = uProjectionMatrix * viewModelPosition;  
  // Pass along data to the fragment shader
  vTexCoord = aTexCoord;
  vVertexColor = aVertexColor;
}
```

### Fragment Shaders

The fragment shader is responsible for the color output of our shader and is where we will do a lot of our shader programming. Here is a very simple fragment shader that will just display the color red:

<AnnotatedCode lang="glsl" code={({ begin, end }) =>
`${begin('precision')}
precision highp float;
${end('precision')}
${begin('main')}
void main() {
  vec4 myColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
  gl_FragColor = myColor;
}
${end('main')}`}>
<Fragment slot="precision">
  The fragment shader begins again with a line specifying the float `precision`. This should match the `precision` in your vertex shader.
</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="main">

Similar to the vertex shader, our fragment shader also requires a `main()` function, but instead of setting `gl_Position`, we will assign a color to a special variable defined by GLSL called `gl_FragColor`.

The variable, `myColor`, is defined as a `vec4`, meaning it stores four values. Since we are dealing with color, those four values are red, green, blue, and alpha. Shaders don't use 0-255 for colors like our p5.js sketches do by default. Instead, they use values between 0.0 and 1.0.

</Fragment>
</AnnotatedCode>

Now that we have a vertex shader and a fragment shader, these can be saved to separate files (`shader.vert` and `shader.frag`, respectively) and loaded into our sketch using `loadShader()`.


## Uniforms: Passing data from sketch to shader

A simple shader like this can be useful by itself, but there are times when it's necessary to communicate variables from the p5.js sketch to a shader. This is when uniforms come in. Uniforms are a type of variable that can be sent from a sketch to a shader. These make it possible to have much more control over a shader from JavaScript.

Uniforms are defined at the top of the file, outside of `main()`. You can access them in both your vertex and your fragment shader. In the example below, the value returned by the p5.js method `millis()` is passed to a 'time' uniform to introduce motion in the vertex shader.

<EditableSketch code={`
let myShader;

// Our vertex shader source as a string
let vert = \`
precision highp float;

attribute vec3 aPosition;

// The transform of the object being drawn
uniform mat4 uModelViewMatrix;

// Transforms 3D coordinates to 2D screen coordinates
uniform mat4 uProjectionMatrix;

// A custom uniform with the time in milliseconds
uniform float time;

void main() {
  // Apply the camera transform
  vec4 viewModelPosition = uModelViewMatrix * vec4(aPosition, 1.0);

  // Use the time to adjust the position of the vertices
  viewModelPosition.x += 10.0 * sin(time * 0.01 + viewModelPosition.y * 0.1);

  // Tell WebGL where the vertex goes
  gl_Position = uProjectionMatrix * viewModelPosition;  
}
\`;

let frag = \`
precision highp float;

void main() {
  vec4 myColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
  gl_FragColor = myColor;
}
\`

function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200, WEBGL);
  myShader = createShader(vert, frag);
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  noStroke();
  
  // Use our custom shader
  shader(myShader);
  
  // Pass the time from p5 to the shader
  myShader.setUniform('time', millis());
  
  // Draw a shape using the shader
  circle(0, 0, 100);
}
`} />

It also works in the fragment shader. In the following example, we create a color uniform, `myColor`, that will allow us to change the color from the JavaScript part of our sketch. Just remember that in shaders, color channel values go from 0-1 instead of 0-255.


<EditableSketch code={`
let myShader;

// Our vertex shader source as a string
let vert = \`
precision highp float;

attribute vec3 aPosition;

// The transform of the object being drawn
uniform mat4 uModelViewMatrix;

// Transforms 3D coordinates to 2D screen coordinates
uniform mat4 uProjectionMatrix;

void main() {
  // Apply the camera transform
  vec4 viewModelPosition = uModelViewMatrix * vec4(aPosition, 1.0);

  // Tell WebGL where the vertex goes
  gl_Position = uProjectionMatrix * viewModelPosition;  
}
\`;

let frag = \`
precision highp float;

// A custom uniform to control the color
uniform vec4 myColor;

void main() {
  gl_FragColor = myColor;
}
\`

function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200, WEBGL);
  myShader = createShader(vert, frag);
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  noStroke();
  
  // Use our custom shader
  shader(myShader);
  
  // Create a color using the mouse's x position as red and
  // its y position as blue, and pass it into the shader
  myShader.setUniform('myColor', [
    map(mouseX, 0, width, 0, 1, true), // Red
    map(mouseY, 0, width, 0, 1, true), // Green
    0, // Blue
    1 // Alpha
  ]);
  
  // Draw a shape using the shader
  circle(0, 0, 100);
}
`} />

You can see the complete list of uniforms that p5.js provides for you in the [p5.js WebGL Mode Architecture](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/main/contributor_docs/webgl_mode_architecture.md) document.


## Varyings: Passing data from vertex to fragment shader

*Varying* variables share data between the vertex shader and the fragment shader. This makes it possible to use position or other geometry data within our fragment shaders.

For example, you may want to use a shape's texture coordinates in the fragment shader. These come in the form of a `vec2`, where coordinates go between 0 and 1. This initially comes in an `attribute` from p5.js, and those are only accessible in the vertex shader. Let's look at what our standard vertex shader does to pass that to fragment shaders:

<AnnotatedCode lang="glsl" code={({ begin, end }) =>
`precision highp float;

attribute vec3 aPosition;
${begin('texcoord')}
attribute vec2 aTexCoord;
${end('texcoord')}
attribute vec4 aVertexColor;

uniform mat4 uModelViewMatrix;
uniform mat4 uProjectionMatrix;

${begin('varying')}
varying vec2 vTexCoord;
${end('varying')}
varying vec4 vVertexColor;
void main() {
  // Apply the camera transform
  vec4 viewModelPosition = uModelViewMatrix * vec4(aPosition, 1.0);
  // Tell WebGL where the vertex goes
  gl_Position = uProjectionMatrix * viewModelPosition;
${begin('assign')}
  vVertexColor = aVertexColor;
${end('assign')}
}
`}>
  <Fragment slot="texcoord">
    The texture coordinates initially come in the form of an `attribute` called `aTexCoord`. This is automatically filled in by p5.js.
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="varying">
    Here, we declare a `varying` variable. Any varying you declare in a vertex shader, you can again declare in the fragment shader, where you can then access the value assigned to it by the vertex shader.
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="assign">
    By assigning the *attribute's* value to the *varying* variable, we are copying the data to a spot where the fragment shader can read it.
  </Fragment>
</AnnotatedCode>

Since we defined a `varying` called `vTexCoord` in the vertex shader, we can now use it in the fragment shader as well. Here is a simple fragment shader that maps the x value to the red channel and the y value to the blue channel. Note that while `vTexCoord` is defined *per vertex* in the vertex shader, its value is defined *per pixel* in the fragment shader. To get the per-pixel value, WebGL smoothly interpolates between the per-vertex values on each face.

<AnnotatedCode lang="glsl" code={({ begin, end }) =>
`${begin('shader')}
precision highp float;
varying vec2 vTexCoord;
void main() {
  // Assign the coordinates to the color output of the shader
  gl_FragColor = vec4(vTexCoord.x, vTexCoord.y, 1.0, 1.0);
}
${end('shader')}`}>
  <Fragment slot="shader">

    The result of using this shader on a `plane(width, height)`:

    <Image alt="A rectangular gradient with black in the top left corner, magenta in the top right, white and the bottom right, and cyan in the bottom left." width="100" src={uv} />

  </Fragment>
</AnnotatedCode>


## Filter Shaders

In p5.js, a filter is something that looks at all the pixels on the canvas and then replaces them with something else. There are many built-in filters that do things like invert the colors of the canvas, or apply a blur to the canvas contents. You can make your own filter by writing a fragment shader for it.

Filter shaders only need a fragment shader. Vertex shaders are primarily responsible for positioning shapes, and filters always apply to the whole canvas, so p5.js provides a default vertex shader for you. Rather than using `loadShader`, you use `createFilterShader(src)`, passing in a string with your shader source code.

There are a number of `uniform`s that will be available to you in a filter shader, and you can read about all of them [in the `createFilterShader` documentation.](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/createFilterShader) There are two main ones to know about to get started:

- `uniform sampler2D tex0` is a texture containing the contents of the canvas.
- `varying vec2 vTexCoord` contains the coordinates on the canvas of the current pixel, ranging from 0 to 1.

Combining these, `texture2D(tex0, vTexCoord)` returns the color of the current pixel on the canvas, which you can then modify. In this example, we create a custom black-and-white filter by replacing the red and green channels with the blue channel:

<EditableSketch code={`
let video;
let bw;

let bwSrc = \`
precision highp float;

uniform sampler2D tex0;
varying vec2 vTexCoord;

void main() {
  // Get the original color for this pixel
  vec4 color = texture2D(tex0, vTexCoord);

  // Make it black and white by replacing all channels with blue
  color.r = color.b;
  color.g = color.b;

  // Set the new color
  gl_FragColor = color;
}
\`;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200, WEBGL);
  video = createVideo(
    'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/DiagonalCrosswalkYongeDundas.webm'
  );
  video.volume(0);
  video.hide();
  video.loop();
  
  bw = createFilterShader(bwSrc);
  
  describe('A video of a city crosswalk in black and white');
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  push();
  imageMode(CENTER);
  image(video, 0, 0, width, height, 0, 0, video.width, video.height, COVER);
  pop();
  filter(bw);
}
`} />

Another thing you might want to try is modifying the *input* to `texture2D` rather than modifying its output. Adjusting the texture coordinate used can create an offset from the original or a warp effect if the offset is different per pixel:

<EditableSketch code={`
let video;
let warp;

let warpSrc = \`
precision highp float;

uniform sampler2D tex0;
varying vec2 vTexCoord;

void main() {
  // Offset the input coordinate
  vec2 warpedCoord = vTexCoord;
  warpedCoord.x += 0.05 * sin(vTexCoord.y * 10.0);
  warpedCoord.y += 0.05 * sin(vTexCoord.x * 10.0);

  // Set the new color by looking up the warped coordinate
  gl_FragColor = texture2D(tex0, warpedCoord);
}
\`;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200, WEBGL);
  video = createVideo(
    'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/DiagonalCrosswalkYongeDundas.webm'
  );
  video.volume(0);
  video.hide();
  video.loop();
  
  warp = createFilterShader(warpSrc);
  
  describe('A warped video of a city crosswalk');
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  push();
  imageMode(CENTER);
  image(video, 0, 0, width, height, 0, 0, video.width, video.height, COVER);
  pop();
  filter(warp);
}
`} />

## Conclusion

With these skills you can create some basic shaders, but shader programming can go much further, and many shader topics go beyond this tutorial. Shaders in p5.js can be a powerful tool for creating visuals, effects, and textures that can be mapped to your 3D geometry.
