This tutorial will introduce new concepts for creating 3D sketches with p5.js, including x, y, and z.

Let's start by setting up the p5.js to use WebGL, by passing `WEBGL` as a third parameter into `createCanvas()`.

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight, WEBGL);
  describe('A red box on a white background.');
}
function draw() {
  background(255);
  fill(255, 0, 0);
  box();
}
```

## 3D coordinate space

2D sketches use the x- and y-axes to define horizontal and vertical positions. 3D sketches extend this model with a z-axis which defines depth. When drawing in 2D, the point (0,0) is located at the top left corner of the screen. In WebGL mode, the origin of the sketch (0,0,0) is located in the middle of the screen. By default, the x-axis goes left to right, the y-axis goes up to down, and the z-axis goes from further to closer, “out of” the screen.

![An illustration showing a 2D coordinate system on the left, showing an origin of (0,0) at its top left, and a 3D coordinate system on the right, showing an origin of (0,0,0) in its center](../images/webgl/2d3d_coordinates.png)

You can call [`debugMode()`](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/debugMode) in your `setup()` function to add a grid on the x- and z-axes and the red-green-blue x, y, and z arrows to your sketch, similar to the illustration above.


## Transformations: Position and Size of 3D Shapes

p5.js has a few functions that we can use to position and orient objects within 3D space: `translate()`, `rotate()`, and `scale()`. Collectively these are known as the *transformation* of an object. These methods are available for both 2D and 3D drawing.


### `translate()`: Moving Objects in Space

<SketchEmbed
  code={await fs.readFile("src/content/tutorials/sketches/coordinates-and-transformation/translate/sketch.js")}
  cssCode={await fs.readFile("src/content/tutorials/sketches/coordinates-and-transformation/style.css")}
  bodyCode={await fs.readFile("src/content/tutorials/sketches/coordinates-and-transformation/translate/index.html")}
/>

`translate()` moves the origin to a given point. Anything drawn after we call `translate()` will be positioned relative to that point. `translate()` accepts arguments for x, y, and z values. Use the sliders in the sketch above to change the translation of the box and see how it moves along each axis. The code snippet below demonstrates simple translation on a `box()` shape.

```javascript
// draw a box 100 units to the right
translate(100,0,0);
box();
```

A [random walk](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Random_walk_2500_animated.svg) involves moving in a random direction each step. Try doing a random walk in 3D using `translate()`, drawing a cube after each step like a trail of breadcrumbs!

### `rotate()`: Orienting Objects in Space

<SketchEmbed
  code={await fs.readFile("src/content/tutorials/sketches/coordinates-and-transformation/rotate/sketch.js")}
  cssCode={await fs.readFile("src/content/tutorials/sketches/coordinates-and-transformation/style.css")}
  bodyCode={await fs.readFile("src/content/tutorials/sketches/coordinates-and-transformation/rotate/index.html")}
/>

`rotate()` reorients whatever is drawn after it.

There are a few functions that can be used to rotate an object in 3D. Most of the time, it's easiest to call functions like `rotateX()`, `rotateY()`, and `rotateZ()`, which each allow for rotation around a specific axis. Each function accepts a single argument specifying the angle of rotation. Try moving the sliders in the example above to see how rotation is performed on each axis. The code below shows each of these methods in use.

```javascript
// rotate X, Y, and Z axes by 45 degrees
rotateX(QUARTER_PI);
rotateY(QUARTER_PI);
rotateZ(QUARTER_PI);
box();
```

By default, p5.js expects angles to be in radians. Radians use numbers from 0 to `TWO_PI` to specify an angle. To use degrees, either convert degrees to radians using `radians(numberInDegrees)` or use `angleMode(DEGREES)`:

```javascript
// rotate each axis by 45 degrees
rotateX(radians(45));
box();
// or
angleMode(DEGREES);
rotateY(45);
box();
```

You can also use `rotate(angle, axis)`, which allows you to specify which axis you'd like to rotate around using a vector as the second argument. This lets you rotate a shape about any axis you choose. In the example below, we create an axis using the mouse coordinates, and rotate about it:

<EditableSketch code={`function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200, WEBGL);
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
 
  // Slowly rotate over time
  let angle = millis() * 0.001;
 
  // The axis of rotation will be the line
  // going through the center of the canvas
  // and the mouse
  let axis = createVector(
    mouseX - width/2,
    mouseY - height/2,
    0
  );
 
  // Visualize the axis
  strokeWeight(3);
  stroke('red');
  line(0, 0, 0, axis.x, axis.y, axis.z);
  stroke('blue');
  line(0, 0, 0, -axis.x, -axis.y, -axis.z);
 
  // Rotate a box about that axis
  lights();
  noStroke();
  rotate(angle, axis);
  box();
}`} />

### `scale()`: Size in Space

<SketchEmbed
  code={await fs.readFile("src/content/tutorials/sketches/coordinates-and-transformation/scale/sketch.js")}
  cssCode={await fs.readFile("src/content/tutorials/sketches/coordinates-and-transformation/style.css")}
  bodyCode={await fs.readFile("src/content/tutorials/sketches/coordinates-and-transformation/scale/index.html")}
/>

`scale()` changes the size of whatever is drawn after it. Like the other functions described, it accepts arguments for x, y, and z values.

<Callout>

Try making a cube jump up and down, but use `scale()` to have it [squash and stretch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_and_stretch) when it bounces to give it a cartoon feel!

</Callout>


## Transforming Multiple Shapes

Transform functions are cumulative and affect everything drawn after them. For example, if you call `translate(50, 0, 0)` twice, they add together, making it equivalent to calling `translate(100, 0, 0)` once.  However, sometimes you will want to draw different shapes with different transformations.

The `push()` function saves the current transformations and style settings. Then, after performing new transformations, the `pop()` function is used to restore us to the original transformations. The result is that whatever transformations or styling changes that are made between `push()` and `pop()` are isolated to that portion of the code. In the example below, we draw a number of boxes at their own distinct locations by placing their transforms between `push()` and `pop()`:

<EditableSketch code={`
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200, WEBGL);
}
function draw() {
  background(220);
  noStroke();
  lights();
  orbitControl();
 
  push();
  translate(-50, 0, -100);
  fill('red');
  sphere(50);
  pop();
 
  push();
  translate(0, -100, -300);
  fill('green');
  sphere(50);
  pop();
 
  push();
  translate(25, 25, 50);
  fill('blue');
  sphere(50);
  pop();
}
`} />

<summary>Transformation Matrices</summary>

*While this is a more advanced topic, each of these transformations affects what is called the model matrix. The model matrix is combined with the view matrix and the projection matrix, both of which help simulate the view of a camera, and this combination results in our 3D scene! You can* [*learn more about Model View Projection on MDN.*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/WebGL_model_view_projection)

## The Order of Transformations Matters!

The way transformations affect each other can feel unpredictable at first because order matters. Each transformation always affects the next one. For example, if `rotate()` is called, followed by `translate()`, the direction of that translation will be affected by the rotation. The entire coordinate system is rotating and moving, not just the shape itself. Here are some recipes for different transformation orders that you can use.


### The Default: Positioning Objects in a Scene

If you are drawing many objects, chances are that each one will have a unique position, orientation, and scale. For this, you should first `translate()` to the center of where the object should be, then `rotate()` to match its orientation, and finally `scale()` to fit its size. This is a good order to use by default.

<EditableSketch code={`
let positions = [];
let rotations = [];
let scales = [];
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200, WEBGL);
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    positions.push(createVector(
      random(-width / 2, width / 2),
      random(-height / 2, height / 2),
      random(-width / 2, width / 2)
    ));
    rotations.push(createVector(
      random(TWO_PI),
      random(TWO_PI),
      random(TWO_PI)
    ));
    scales.push(random(0.5, 2));
  }
}
function draw() {
  background(255);
  orbitControl();
  noStroke();
  lights();
 
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) {
    push();
    translate(
      positions[i].x,
      positions[i].y,
      positions[i].z
    );
    rotateX(rotations[i].x);
    rotateY(rotations[i].y);
    rotateZ(rotations[i].z);
    scale(scales[i]);
    box(20);
    pop();
  }
}
`} />

Try making a solar system, where each planet has its own independent position as it moves around the sun, and each has its own rotation as they spin at different speeds!

### Rotating Around a Pivot Point

Sometimes you want to rotate a shape about a point that isn't its center. For this, you can `translate()` to the pivot point, `rotate()` or `scale()` as needed, and then `translate()` back to the center before drawing your shape. The sketch below uses this method to make a shape squash and stretch about its base rather than its center.

<EditableSketch code={`
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200, WEBGL);
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  orbitControl();
  noStroke();
  lights();
 
  // Rotate left/right over time
  let angle = sin(millis() * 0.005) * PI * 0.2;
 
  // This represents how much to scale vertically by.
  let squash = map(
    sin(millis() * 0.0125),
    -1, 1,
    1, 0.3
  );
 
  // When vertically compressed, squish out in the
  // other axes.
  let stretch = 1/squash;
  let pivot = createVector(0, 50, 0);
 
  push()
  translate(pivot.x, pivot.y, pivot.z);
 
  // Apply a transformation centered at the pivot
  rotateZ(angle);
  scale(stretch, squash, stretch);
 
  translate(-pivot.x, -pivot.y, -pivot.z);
  cylinder(20, 100);
  pop()
}
`} />

Try making a character waving its arm! You will want to rotate the arm about the point where the arm connects to its body so that it stays connected.

### Drawing with Symmetry

Sometimes you want to draw the same thing multiple times with mirror or radial symmetry. In these cases, you will end up drawing in a loop. For each iteration, `rotate()` or `scale()` depending on the type of symmetry you want. Finally, apply any other transformations needed to draw your shape.

In the example below, `scale(-1, 1)` is used to add horizontal symmetry to draw the eyes and ears of a face:

<EditableSketch code={`
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200, WEBGL);
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  lights();
  noStroke();
  orbitControl();
 
  // The head
  push();
  scale(1, 1.25, 1);
  sphere(50);
  pop();
 
  // The nose
  push()
  translate(0, 0, 50);
  scale(1, 1.5, 1);
  sphere(10);
  pop()
 
  // Draw symmetrical parts by looping over each
  // side, represented by the horizontal scale applied.
  for (let side of [-1, 1]) {
    push();
    // Apply the symmetrical transformation
    scale(side, 1, 1);
   
    // Eyes
    push();
    translate(20, -10, 40);
    sphere(8);
    pop();
   
    // Ears
    push();
    translate(50, 0, 0);
    scale(1, 1, 0.3);
    sphere(20);
    pop();
   
    pop();
  }
}
`} />

	
In this example, `rotateY()` is used to create radial symmetry for a stonehenge scene.

<EditableSketch code={`
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200, WEBGL);
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  noStroke();
  lights();
  orbitControl();
 
  let numArches = 6;
 
  for (let i = 0; i < numArches; i++) {
    const angle = map(i, 0, numArches-1, -PI/2, PI/2);
   
    // Apply radially symmetrical transformation
    push();
    rotateY(angle);
   
    // Draw each arch
    translate(0, 0, -150);
   
    // Left beam
    push();
    translate(-20, 0, 0);
    cylinder(10, 100);
    pop();
   
    // Right beam
    push();
    translate(20, 0, 0);
    cylinder(10, 100);
    pop();
   
    // Top
    push();
    translate(0, -50, 0);
    rotateZ(PI/2);
    cylinder(10, 80);
    pop();
   
    pop();
  }
}
`} />
