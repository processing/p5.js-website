## Introduction

While the p5.js Web Editor is a great place to create and share sketches, you might want to embed your p5.js projects in other webpages—like a personal portfolio, blog, or documentation site. One of the most straightforward and flexible ways to do this is by using an `<iframe>` element.

An iframe (inline frame) allows you to embed one HTML document inside another. This approach has several advantages:

- You can use **global mode** p5.js code without worrying about conflicts
- You can have **multiple sketches** on the same page, each in its own iframe
- Your sketch runs in an **isolated environment**, preventing naming conflicts with the parent page
- You can easily **dynamically load and unload** sketches for better performance

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, you should:

- Have a basic understanding of HTML
- Have a p5.js sketch ready to embed (either from the Web Editor or a local project)

## Step 1: Create Your p5.js Sketch

First, you'll need a p5.js sketch to embed. Here's a simple example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My p5.js Sketch</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.9.0/lib/p5.js"></script>
    <style>
      body {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        overflow: hidden;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      function setup() {
        createCanvas(400, 400);
      }

      function draw() {
        background(220);
        fill(255, 0, 200);
        ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50);
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Save this as `sketch.html` in a folder on your computer or web server.

## Step 2: Embed the Sketch Using an iframe

Now, in your main webpage, you can embed the sketch using an `<iframe>` element:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Portfolio</title>
    <style>
      .sketch-container {
        width: 400px;
        height: 400px;
        border: 2px solid #333;
        margin: 20px auto;
      }
      iframe {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        border: none;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My Creative Coding Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Check out my interactive sketch below!</p>
    
    <div class="sketch-container">
      <iframe src="sketch.html" title="Interactive p5.js sketch"></iframe>
    </div>
    
    <p>More content can go here...</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

<Callout variant="helpful">
**Accessibility Tip:** Always include a `title` attribute on your iframe that describes what the embedded content is. This helps screen reader users understand what the iframe contains.
</Callout>

## Step 3: Embedding Web Editor Sketches

If your sketch is hosted on the p5.js Web Editor, you can embed it directly by using the full-screen URL:

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://editor.p5js.org/username/full/sketchID"
  width="400" 
  height="400"
  title="My p5.js sketch from the Web Editor">
</iframe>
```

To get the full-screen URL from the Web Editor:
1. Open your sketch in the p5.js Web Editor
2. Click **File** → **Share** → **Fullscreen**
3. Copy the URL provided

## Step 4: Multiple Sketches on One Page

One of the key advantages of using iframes is that you can embed multiple sketches on the same page without conflicts:

```html
<div class="sketch-container">
  <h2>Sketch 1</h2>
  <iframe src="sketch1.html" width="400" height="400" title="First sketch"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="sketch-container">
  <h2>Sketch 2</h2>
  <iframe src="sketch2.html" width="400" height="400" title="Second sketch"></iframe>
</div>
```

Each sketch runs in its own isolated environment, so global variables and function names won't conflict.

## Step 5: Performance Optimization with Dynamic Loading

For pages with many sketches, you can improve performance by dynamically loading and unloading iframes when they scroll into view:

```html
<div class="sketch-container" data-sketch-src="sketch.html">
  <div class="loading">Loading sketch...</div>
</div>

<script>
  // Create an Intersection Observer to load sketches when they're visible.
  const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
    entries.forEach((entry) => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting === true) {
        const container = entry.target;
        const sketchSrc = container.dataset.sketchSrc;
        
        if (sketchSrc && !container.querySelector('iframe')) {
          const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
          iframe.src = sketchSrc;
          iframe.width = '400';
          iframe.height = '400';
          iframe.title = 'p5.js sketch';
          
          container.innerHTML = '';
          container.appendChild(iframe);
        }
      }
    });
  }, {
    // Start loading slightly before it comes into view.
    rootMargin: '50px',
  });

  // Observe all sketch containers.
  document.querySelectorAll('.sketch-container').forEach((container) => {
    observer.observe(container);
  });
</script>
```

This technique is used on the p5.js website itself to efficiently handle pages with many example sketches!

## Styling and Responsive Design

You can make your embedded sketches responsive using CSS:

```css
.sketch-container {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 600px;
  /* Maintain square aspect ratio. */
  aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.sketch-container iframe {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  border: none;
}
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Sketch doesn't load

**Solution:** Make sure the `src` path in your iframe is correct. If the sketch file is in the same directory as your HTML file, use just the filename. If it's in a subdirectory, include the path (e.g., `src="sketches/sketch.html"`).

### Issue: Sketch is cut off

**Solution:** Ensure the iframe's width and height match your canvas size, or make sure your sketch canvas is sized to fit within the iframe.

### Issue: CORS errors when loading from Web Editor

**Solution:** The p5.js Web Editor handles CORS correctly when you use the full-screen URL format. Make sure you're using `https://editor.p5js.org/username/full/sketchID` and not the edit URL.

## Next Steps

Now that you know how to embed sketches with iframes, you might want to explore:

- Loading sketches directly into a container using [Instance Mode](../p5-instance-mode) (coming soon)
- Using p5.js with modern JavaScript modules
- Integrating p5.js with React or other frameworks

Happy coding!
