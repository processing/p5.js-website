p5.js was selected to receive a total of ‚Ç¨450,000 through two rounds of funding from the [Sovereign Tech Fund](https://sovereigntechfund.de/en) to enhance [p5.js Documentation organization & accessibility](https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/tech/p5js). This work is part of the Sovereign Tech Fund‚Äôs [Contribute Back to Open Source Challenges](https://sovereigntechfund.de/en/challenges/).

This project addressed the longstanding challenges of scatterness and limited accessibility within the p5.js documentation. The final deliverable includes an updated p5.js website with a focus on accessible, organized, and translated contributor documentation. Additionally, the website features a curated collection of community sketches, an add-ons library, and educational resources.

By providing improved contributor documentation, the project aims to facilitate effective navigation and feature exploration, empowering users to create richer and more innovative projects with p5.js. Furthermore, the improved documentation promotes accessibility and inclusivity, ensuring that people from diverse backgrounds, skill levels, and cultures can engage meaningfully with p5.js.


## Contributors

This project brought together approximately 140 contributors, with 60-75 participating in each round. The team included both experienced and first-time contributors, forming a global group dedicated to writing, translating, designing, engineering, researching, and conducting accessibility reviews.

While open-source contributors typically operate independently, this project fostered collective efforts, encouraging collaboration among individuals with diverse skills and perspectives. This shift towards more collaborative endeavors has led to a more cohesive and synergistic approach to advancing the p5.js project, exemplifying the strength of community-driven initiatives in the open-source landscape.
