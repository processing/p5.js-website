About this repository (This should go to the INTRO section)

Hi there! Welcome to p5.js contributing! Here are a few things to know:

This repository contains the p5.js website, including:

- Reference pages and documentation
- Examples and embedded sketches used on the site
- Website-specific UI, layout, and accessibility improvements

If you have a general question or bug programming with p5.js please post it in the p5.js forum or ask in our Discord server (check the #contribute-to-p5 channel).

Please make sure you are posting to the correct repository. See this section for a list of all p5.js repositories.


Please be sure to review our community statement and code of conduct. These things are very important to us.
Check out the contributor docs for more in-depth details about contributing code, bug fixes, and documentation.

### p5.js-website vs p5.js
If you are seeing an issue about unclear wording, missing explanations, outdated examples, or reference structure, please open an issue in this repository.
If the issue appears to be a bug or behavior change in the p5.js library itself, please open an issue in the core p5.js repository.

If you’re unsure where an issue belongs, feel free to open it here with as much context as possible, and a maintainer can help route it.

### Get Assigned Before Working on an Issue
Please read the Contributor guidelines before contributing: https://p5js.org/contribute/contributor_guidelines/

When an issue is first created, it may be labeled Under review, which means it is still being reviewed by maintainers and is not yet ready for work. Please do not start work on these issues.

Once an issue has been reviewed and approved, it will be labeled Ready to contribute. Only issues with this label should be requested for assignment. When a contributor is set as “Assignee”, they can start working on it.

If you file a PR for an issue that has not been approved for contribution, or while someone else is already working on it, your PR may be closed.






## How To Contribute
Known bugs and intended new features are tracked using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/issues). If you'd like to start working on an existing issue, comment on the issue that you plan to work on it so other contributors know it's being handled and can offer help. Once you have completed your work on this issue, [submit a pull request (PR)](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/main/contributor_docs/contributor_guidelines.md#pull-requests) to the p5.js main branch. In the description field of the PR, include "resolves #XXXX" tagging the issue you are fixing. If the PR addresses the issue but doesn't completely resolve it (ie the issue should remain open after your PR is merged), write "addresses #XXXX".

If you discover a bug or have an idea for a new feature you'd like to add, begin by submitting an issue. Please do not simply submit a pull request containing the fix or new feature without making an issue first, we will probably not be able to accept it.
