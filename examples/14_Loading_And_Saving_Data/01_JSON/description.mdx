<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON" target="_blank">JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON</a>,
is a format for writing data in a file. While the syntax comes from
JavaScript, JSON is used in many other contexts. This example  is
based on Daniel Shiffman's Loading JSON Data Example for Processing
written in Java. It uses a
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/class" target="_blank">class</a>
to organize data for a bubble. When the sketch starts, it
loads the data for two bubbles from a JSON file. The visitor can add
new bubbles, download an updated JSON file, and load in a JSON file.
