The
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createGraphics" target="_blank">createGraphics()</a>
function can be used to create a new p5.Graphics object, which can serve as
an off-screen graphics buffer within the canvas. Off-screen buffers can have
different dimensions and properties than their current display surface, even
though they appear to be existing in the same space.
