# Which content is where?

## Reference

- Stored in `/src/content/reference/`
- English version is pulled in from p5.js repo via [scripts](./scripts.md)
- Other translations are stored directly in this repo under the corresponding language folder in `/src/content/reference/`

## Examples

- Stored in `/src/content/examples/`
- All translations are stored and edited directly in this repo under the corresponding language folder in `/src/content/examples/`

All original examples (created new for p5.js) since 2024 are collectively attributed to p5.js Contributors under the CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. However, examples that build on prior work (under a compatible license) can be attributed in more detail, to make sure that authorship is clear in citation, and code history is available to viewers.

To add attribution, you can use the following block in the headers, listing in **chronological** order all attribution. Below is the example from `examples/animation-and-variables-conditions/`:

```yaml
remix:
  - description: Inspired by
    attribution:
      - name: Name Name
        URL: a-valid-link
    code:
      - label: pre-2023 code
        URL: a-valid-link
  - description: Revised by
    attribution:    
      - name: Name Name
        URL: a-valid-link
    code:
      - label: 2023 revision code
        URL: a-valid-link

  - collectivelyAttributedSince: 2024
```

This will result in a block that lists, in order, the initial inspiration; any revision or other remix; and the collective attribution statement that begins in 2024: "From 2024 onwards, edited and maintained by p5.js Contributors and the Processing Foundation. Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0."

A remix can be many things ([here is an example analysis of sketch remixing (PDF)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3563657.3595969)); the `description` will be by default "Remixed by", so a more specific description is recommended.

To credit individuals, you can use the following descriptions, with `attribution.name` including the name of the author or contributor, with an optional link.

* Remixed by
* Revised by
* Created by

```yaml
remix:
  - description: Created by
    attribution:
      - name: Someone
        URL: ...
```

To credit a specific work that was (1) not created by the p5.js contributors since 2024 and (2) is under a compatible license, you can use the following descriptions. Here, `attribution.name` should include both the person and a specific work of theirs that was the inspiration.

* Inspired by
* Based on

```yaml
remix:
  - description: Inspired by
    attribution:
      - name: Someone's prior work
        URL: ...
```

Each item in the remix history must have an at least one person listed in the attribution section. When multiple people are listed, their names will be shown **in that order**. For people, URLs are optional but recommended.

These attribution histories **do not need to be individually translated** for each sketch. It is enough to make sure that the descriptions (like 'Created by' and so on) appear in the different language strings in `src/content/ui/`. Then, these will be used for all examples. See [Localization](./localization.md) for more info. If you use special descriptions or names in the attribution, these do need either new strings, or localization in the respective example translations (in `src/content/examples/{language}`).

If the `collectivelyAttributedSince` information is missing, then no year will be included, but the collective attribution statement will still show: "Edited and maintained by p5.js Contributors and the Processing Foundation. Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0." You'll see this in examples that were part of a major revision project with specific attribution, but have collective authorship before and after. Note that the collective attribution message either does not specify a year,
 or specifies 2024. To add a new possible value, update:

1. `content/examples/config.ts` to include new permitted values;
2. and `content/ui/{language}.yaml` strings for attribution to include the text
